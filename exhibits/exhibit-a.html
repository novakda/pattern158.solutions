            </div>
            <div class="background-content">
                <p>In 2008, I was assigned to sign off on accessibility audits for Electric Boat's eLearning content &mdash; with zero formal training in accessibility standards, no WCAG certification, and no existing methodology. Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics building nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy, required Section 508 compliance for all training materials. The expectation: enterprise-grade accessibility verification. The reality: I had to build the practice from scratch.</p>

                <p>What followed was not a single project but a 14-year evolution (2008-2022) where accessibility methodology, cross-domain SCORM expertise, and embedded technical advisory converged into a comprehensive engagement spanning <strong>574 emails across 49 personnel</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>The arc:</strong> No training → Technical methodology → Organizational standard. This exhibit documents that full trajectory.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="background-content">
                <p>Without formal training, I reverse-engineered accessibility compliance through a combination of WCAG documentation study, screen reader testing (JAWS, NVDA), and iterative validation against Section 508 requirements. The methodology evolved into a systematic technical audit process:</p>

                <ul class="recommendations-list">
                    <li><strong>Keyboard navigation verification</strong> &mdash; Tab order, focus indicators, skip navigation, keyboard traps</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen reader compatibility</strong> &mdash; ARIA labels, alt text, semantic HTML, form labels, error identification</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual accessibility</strong> &mdash; Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA), text resizing, responsive layouts</li>
                    <li><strong>Media accessibility</strong> &mdash; Captions, transcripts, audio descriptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive load mitigation</strong> &mdash; Clear navigation, consistent UI patterns, timeout warnings</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This methodology became the foundation for all subsequent EB accessibility audits and, later, GP Strategies' division-wide accessibility standard. What started as "figure it out" became documented, repeatable process engineering.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="background-content">
                <p>In 2015, the engagement expanded beyond accessibility into technical infrastructure. Electric Boat used <span class="key-fact">Cornerstone OnDemand</span> as their Learning Management System, with course content hosted on separate internal EB servers &mdash; a cross-domain architecture causing persistent training delivery failures. The LMS was hosted externally by Cornerstone; EB's content resided on internal EB network servers. This split created a same-origin policy conflict that broke standard LMS-to-course communication protocols.</p>

                <p>GP Strategies Corporation provided learning solutions to General Dynamics/Electric Boat as a <strong>major client</strong>. GP maintained an on-site training support team at EB. The Senior Vice President of Learning Solutions flagged the cross-domain SCORM issue as a strategic engagement opportunity and directed the technical team to pursue resolution.</p>

                <p>This investigation became the second major pillar of the EB relationship: accessibility methodology + technical problem-solving depth.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="probable-cause-box">
                <p>The investigation determined that the <strong>root cause</strong> was Electric Boat's cross-domain architecture: the Cornerstone LMS (hosted externally by Cornerstone OnDemand) and EB's content servers (hosted on the internal EB network) resided on <strong>different domains</strong>. The browser's <code>same-origin policy</code> blocked JavaScript LMS API calls between the course content and the LMS runtime. The Articulate-provided PHP relay script &mdash; intended to bridge this gap via AICC &mdash; had <strong>no error handling</strong> and was silently failing on all cross-domain POST requests.</p>
                <p class="solution-detail">The solution bypassed the AICC/relay architecture entirely by deploying a custom <strong>SCORM cross-domain wrapper</strong> that transparently proxied LMS API calls using <code>postMessage</code> and an intermediary iframe hosted on the LMS domain. This approach eliminated the single point of failure (Cornerstone Network Player) and restored reliable bidirectional communication between course content and the LMS.</p>

                <p>What began as a cross-domain SCORM troubleshooting engagement evolved into a <strong>7-year embedded technical advisory role</strong>. After the August 2018 on-site visit, the relationship intensified rather than concluded. Dan became the Chief of Learning Services' primary escalation resource for complex LMS and courseware issues across the Electric Boat training organization.</p>

                <p>The scope expanded well beyond SCORM wrappers:</p>

                <ul class="recommendations-list">
                    <li><strong>Flash remediation (2019)</strong> &mdash; Rewrote the JavaScript communication layer in legacy ESM courses to restore completion tracking. Provided strategic guidance on Flash-to-HTML5 migration planning for EB's course catalog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chrome 80 impact analysis (2020)</strong> &mdash; Assessed the threat of synchronous XHR deprecation to EB's AICC-based courses and recommended migration paths before the browser change took effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>SCORM 2004 interaction tracking (2020)</strong> &mdash; Extended the cross-domain wrapper to support full SCORM 2004 interaction data, enabling detailed quiz and assessment reporting for EB's nuclear submarine training programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>EB Trades courseware (2022)</strong> &mdash; Continued support for specialized training content including the South Yard Yellow Bird Crane course edits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-domain architecture maintenance (2022)</strong> &mdash; Advised on third-party cookie policy changes and their impact on the deployed wrapper infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="probable-cause-box">
                <p><strong>By the numbers:</strong> 574 documented emails &middot; 49 EB personnel contacts &middot; Peak year 2019 (287 emails) &middot; 2 on-site visits to Groton, CT &middot; Engagement continued through August 2022. The cross-domain SCORM wrapper originally deployed in 2018 remained the foundation of EB's course delivery architecture throughout.</p>

                <span class="section-title">The Full Arc: From No Training to Organizational Standard</span>
            </div>

            <div class="background-content">
                <p>The Electric Boat engagement demonstrates three converging capabilities that evolved from initial knowledge gaps into organizational standards:</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Accessibility Practice (2008–2022)</h3>
                <p>What began as "sign off on accessibility audits with zero training" became a systematic, documented methodology for WCAG/Section 508 compliance. The practice expanded beyond Electric Boat to become GP Strategies' division-wide accessibility audit standard, applied across banking, energy, healthcare, and defense clients.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Methodology I built from scratch without certification became the template for enterprise accessibility verification across a Fortune 500 learning solutions provider.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cross-Domain SCORM Expertise (2015–2022)</h3>
                <p>The SCORM cross-domain wrapper solved a fundamental architectural constraint (browser same-origin policy) that affected not just Electric Boat but any client with split LMS/content hosting. The solution was battle-tested, reusable, and became part of GP Strategies' standard SCORM toolkit for enterprise deployments.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Single technical solution deployed in 2018 remained in production through 2022+, eliminating dependency on Cornerstone Network Player for EB's entire course catalog.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Embedded Technical Advisory (2015–2022)</h3>
                <p>The relationship evolved from project-based troubleshooting into a 7-year embedded advisory role. Dan became the Chief of Learning Services' primary escalation resource for complex LMS and courseware issues &mdash; a trust-based technical partnership spanning Flash remediation, Chrome browser impact analysis, SCORM 2004 extensions, and EB Trades specialized content.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> "Quick win" in 2017 became 7-year strategic engagement generating multi-level recognition cascades and sustained client relationship.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="probable-cause-box">
                <p><strong>The arc, complete:</strong> Assigned accessibility audits with no training (2008) → Built technical methodology through hands-on practice → Became division standard (2010s) → Converged with cross-domain SCORM expertise → Evolved into 7-year embedded advisory role → 574 emails, 49 personnel, 2 on-site visits, sustained through 2022.</p>
