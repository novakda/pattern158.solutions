            <div class="background-content">
                <p>Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics, has been the primary submarine builder for the United States Navy for over <strong>120 years</strong>. Located in Groton, Connecticut, EB designs, builds, and maintains nuclear submarines including the <em>Virginia</em>-class attack submarine and the <em>Columbia</em>-class ballistic missile submarine. With a significant percentage of its workforce approaching retirement within 10 years, recruitment and onboarding became paramount to maintaining institutional knowledge and operational readiness.</p>

                <p>EB used <span class="key-fact">Cornerstone OnDemand</span> as their Learning Management System, with course content hosted on separate internal EB servers &mdash; a cross-domain architecture that caused persistent training delivery failures. The LMS was hosted externally by Cornerstone, while EB's content resided on internal EB network servers. This split created a same-origin policy conflict that broke standard LMS-to-course communication protocols.</p>

                <p>GP Strategies Corporation provided learning solutions to General Dynamics/Electric Boat as a <strong>major client</strong>. GP maintained an on-site training support team at EB. The Senior Vice President of Learning Solutions flagged the engagement opportunity and directed the technical team to pursue resolution.</p>

A co-investigator assisted with testing.</p>

                <p>On the Electric Boat side, the Chief of Learning Services, Metrics, Processes &amp; Technology served as the primary technical counterpart. Two curriculum developers and a training analyst specialist collaborated on testing and provided technical data throughout the engagement.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="probable-cause-box">
                <p>The investigation determined that the <strong>root cause</strong> was Electric Boat's cross-domain architecture: the Cornerstone LMS (hosted externally by Cornerstone OnDemand) and EB's content servers (hosted on the internal EB network) resided on <strong>different domains</strong>. The browser's <code>same-origin policy</code> blocked JavaScript LMS API calls between the course content and the LMS runtime. The Articulate-provided PHP relay script &mdash; intended to bridge this gap via AICC &mdash; had <strong>no error handling</strong> and was silently failing on all cross-domain POST requests.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The solution bypassed the AICC/relay architecture entirely by deploying a custom <strong>SCORM cross-domain wrapper</strong> that transparently proxied LMS API calls using <code>postMessage</code> and an intermediary iframe hosted on the LMS domain. This approach eliminated the single point of failure (Cornerstone Network Player) and restored reliable bidirectional communication between course content and the LMS.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="background-content">
                <p>What began as a cross-domain SCORM troubleshooting engagement evolved into a <strong>7-year embedded technical advisory role</strong>. After the August 2018 on-site visit, the relationship intensified rather than concluded. Dan became the Chief of Learning Services' primary escalation resource for complex LMS and courseware issues across the Electric Boat training organization.</p>

                <p>The scope expanded well beyond SCORM wrappers:</p>

                <ul class="recommendations-list">
                    <li><strong>Flash remediation (2019)</strong> &mdash; Rewrote the JavaScript communication layer in legacy ESM courses to restore completion tracking. Provided strategic guidance on Flash-to-HTML5 migration planning for EB's course catalog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chrome 80 impact analysis (2020)</strong> &mdash; Assessed the threat of synchronous XHR deprecation to EB's AICC-based courses and recommended migration paths before the browser change took effect.</li>
                    <li><strong>SCORM 2004 interaction tracking (2020)</strong> &mdash; Extended the cross-domain wrapper to support full SCORM 2004 interaction data, enabling detailed quiz and assessment reporting for EB's nuclear submarine training programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>EB Trades courseware (2022)</strong> &mdash; Continued support for specialized training content including the South Yard Yellow Bird Crane course edits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-domain architecture maintenance (2022)</strong> &mdash; Advised on third-party cookie policy changes and their impact on the deployed wrapper infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="probable-cause-box">
                <p><strong>By the numbers:</strong> 574 documented emails &middot; 49 EB personnel contacts &middot; Peak year 2019 (287 emails) &middot; 2 on-site visits to Groton, CT &middot; Engagement continued through August 2022. The cross-domain SCORM wrapper originally deployed in 2018 remained the foundation of EB's course delivery architecture throughout.</p>
