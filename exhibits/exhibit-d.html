                <p>Wells Fargo was a critical client in GP Strategies' Top 20 portfolio. In August 2018, Wells Fargo courses needed testing despite Internet Explorer compatibility issues that complicated the process. The volume of testing needs from this account made reliable turnaround essential to the ongoing success of the relationship.</p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>Testing was performed despite Internet Explorer rendering issues that could have been used to justify delays. Rather than waiting for ideal conditions or escalating the IE issues as a blocker, the team worked through the problems to maintain the testing schedule.</p>
                <p>Wells Fargo's volume of testing needs made reliable turnaround essential to the account relationship. The client's willingness to reach out directly to management to express appreciation indicates that the work exceeded normal expectations for responsiveness under adverse technical conditions.</p>

                    Kelly Shute reached out to me today to convey her appreciation for the work that you two did in order to test the WF courses in spite of the fact that you were seeing issues related to IE. Thanks for your hard work on this. WF is a critical client and our ability to meet their volume of needs is important to the success of the relationship.

                <span class="section-number">Section 5</span>
                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Internet Explorer compatibility was a persistent challenge in enterprise e-learning during this period. Many organizations, particularly in financial services, mandated IE as the corporate browser due to legacy application dependencies. Testing courses under IE meant contending with rendering inconsistencies, JavaScript compatibility issues, and SCORM communication quirks that did not exist in modern browsers.</p>
                <p>The team chose to work through these issues rather than delay, understanding that Wells Fargo's high volume of testing needs meant any delay would cascade into missed deadlines across multiple course launches.</p>
