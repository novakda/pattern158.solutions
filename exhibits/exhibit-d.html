                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Wells Fargo engaged GP Strategies in 2018 to execute a large-scale content migration project: transferring over 100 sales and conversion eLearning courses from legacy formats (Adobe Presenter, standalone HTML5, and aging Flash-based modules) into the Xyleme Learning Content Management System (LCMS). The migrated content would then be published as SCORM 1.2 packages for deployment to the Wells Fargo enterprise LMS.</p>
                <p>Dan Novak was assigned as the technical lead for functional quality assurance. The engagement lasted approximately six months and generated 223 emails of technical coordination. Wells Fargo was classified as a critical account for GP Strategies; reliable turnaround on the high volume of deliverables was essential to maintaining the relationship.</p>
                <p>Dan brought prior hands-on experience with Xyleme from his work on the GPiLEARN platform, giving him institutional knowledge of Xyleme's SCORM publishing behavior, its "thin package" architecture, and its interaction quirks with legacy browser environments. Wells Fargo granted Dan full administrative access to their Xyleme Studio instance to facilitate troubleshooting and validation.</p>

            <div class="report-section">
                <span class="section-number">Section 3</span>
                <h2>Technical Contributions</h2>
                <p>Dan's role extended beyond standard functional QA into technical problem-solving and methodology development:</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">QA Budget Estimation Methodology</h3>
                <p>Dan developed a structured approach to estimating QA effort based on interactivity-level multipliers. This methodology allowed the project team to forecast testing time accurately across the 100+ course portfolio, accounting for complexity variance between simple click-through content and highly interactive simulation-based modules. The estimation framework became a repeatable asset for future migration projects.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Xyleme SCORM Publishing Expertise</h3>
                <p>Drawing on his prior work with Xyleme during the GPiLEARN platform development (2012-2013), Dan provided critical technical guidance on Xyleme's SCORM publishing behavior. He understood Xyleme's "thin package" approach — where SCORM content is published as a minimal wrapper that loads the bulk of its assets from a centralized Xyleme server rather than bundling everything into the SCORM ZIP. This architecture had specific implications for LMS integration, caching, and cross-domain security policies that required specialized knowledge to troubleshoot.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Cross-Browser SCORM Failure Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>Dan diagnosed persistent SCORM completion tracking and bookmarking failures in Flash-based legacy content when tested in Internet Explorer. The issue stemmed from ActionScript's interaction with IE's COM-based SCORM API adapter, compounded by Xyleme's thin package architecture introducing additional latency into the API call sequence. Dan documented the failure conditions and provided workarounds to maintain the testing schedule rather than allowing IE compatibility issues to block the project.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Full Administrative Access</h3>
                <p>Wells Fargo granted Dan full administrative access to their Xyleme Studio instance — a level of trust rarely extended to vendor contractors in a financial services environment. This access enabled Dan to validate content structure, inspect publishing settings, and troubleshoot issues directly within the client's production authoring environment.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 4: Findings -->
            <div class="report-section">
                <span class="section-number">Section 4</span>
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>The migration project presented several classes of technical challenges:</p>

                <p><strong>Legacy Format Incompatibilities:</strong> Courses authored in Adobe Presenter (PowerPoint-based) and standalone HTML5 frameworks required significant structural rework to map cleanly into Xyleme's topic-based authoring model. Flash modules, in particular, needed careful handling to ensure ActionScript-based interactions would continue to function when wrapped in Xyleme's SCORM publishing layer.</p>

                <p><strong>Internet Explorer Runtime Environment:</strong> Wells Fargo's corporate browser standard was Internet Explorer, which introduced rendering inconsistencies, JavaScript compatibility issues, and SCORM API communication quirks not present in modern browsers. Testing under IE revealed completion tracking failures in Flash-based content, where the ActionScript-to-JavaScript bridge would intermittently fail to commit learner progress data to the LMS. Dan identified the root cause as a race condition in IE's COM SCORM adapter, exacerbated by Xyleme's thin package latency.</p>

                <p><strong>High-Volume Delivery Cadence:</strong> With over 100 courses in scope and a six-month timeline, the project required a reliable, repeatable QA process. Dan's interactivity-level-based estimation methodology provided the predictability needed to schedule testing across the full course portfolio. The methodology accounted for module complexity, enabling the team to allocate testing resources efficiently and maintain delivery commitments to Wells Fargo.</p>

                <p><strong>Client Relationship Pressure:</strong> Wells Fargo was explicitly identified by GP Strategies leadership as a critical account. Any delays in testing turnaround would cascade into missed course launch deadlines, potentially damaging the strategic relationship. Dan and the QA team maintained the testing schedule despite IE compatibility obstacles that could have been used to justify delays.</p>

                <span class="section-number">Section 6</span>
                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>The Wells Fargo engagement occurred during a transitional period in enterprise eLearning technology. Financial services institutions were migrating away from Flash-based content (Adobe had announced Flash's end-of-life in 2017) while still operating under corporate browser mandates that required Internet Explorer support. This created a narrow compatibility window where content had to function in a legacy browser environment while being architected for a post-Flash future.</p>
                <p>Xyleme represented a modern LCMS approach: topic-based authoring, XML content storage, and multi-channel publishing (SCORM, xAPI, web, mobile). However, Xyleme's thin package SCORM architecture — designed for centralized asset management and version control — introduced integration challenges in environments with strict cross-domain security policies or limited network connectivity. Dan's prior hands-on experience with Xyleme from the GPiLEARN platform gave him the institutional knowledge needed to navigate these architectural constraints.</p>
                <p>The scale of the migration (100+ courses) and the client's strategic importance created a high-pressure environment where technical obstacles could not be allowed to disrupt delivery timelines. The team's ability to maintain QA throughput despite IE compatibility issues demonstrated operational resilience under client relationship pressure.</p>

                    <li><strong>Diagnostic Depth:</strong> Root-caused cross-browser SCORM failures involving Flash ActionScript, IE COM adapters, and Xyleme's thin package latency</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Trust:</strong> Granted full administrative access to Wells Fargo's Xyleme production environment — rare for external contractors in financial services</li>
                    <li><strong>Client-Initiated Feedback:</strong> Wells Fargo contact reached out unprompted to GP Strategies management to express appreciation</li>
                    <li><strong>Delivery Under Pressure:</strong> Maintained high-volume testing cadence for critical account despite known technical obstacles</li>
                </ul>
