                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The AMG Journey was a year-long instructional design project for PNC Financial Services. The team adapted to changing client requirements throughout the engagement while maintaining creative quality. This was a large-scale, cross-functional effort involving designers, editors, developers, and project managers.</p>
                <p>PNC ultimately elevated this project internally as a model for how to approach training design partnerships &mdash; a distinction that reflects not just the quality of the deliverables but the collaborative process that produced them.</p>

                    This was a team recognition. Dan contributed as part of a large cross-functional team. The exhibit is included because it documents the caliber of work and collaboration standards maintained across the team, and because PNC's decision to present this internally as a model validates the quality of the overall engagement.

                <span class="section-number">Section 3</span>
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>The AMG Journey project succeeded despite changing requirements over a year-long timeline. The client specifically identified three factors in their satisfaction:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li><strong>Creativity</strong> &mdash; The design approach was novel enough for PNC to present internally</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptability</strong> &mdash; The team adjusted seamlessly to evolving client needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Partnership</strong> &mdash; PNC called out the collaborative relationship, not just the deliverables</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The fact that PNC was asked to present this series as a model design approach within their organization indicates the project exceeded standard client expectations and was recognized at institutional level.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    I just wanted to pass on a huge job well done and appreciation to all the resources here that have had some part in supporting the AMG Journey project this past year.

                <blockquote>
                    Due to a strong and thoughtful design collaboration early on, this team was able to seamlessly adapt to the changing needs of PNC. Everyone throughout the project was engaged and very collaborative. This team was a model in how resources engage and collaborate with each other and with the client.

                <blockquote>
                    PNC has shared with me that they were asked to present this series as a model design approach internally. On numerous occasions they have complemented this team on their creativity, professionalism, and quality. During a recent project debrief meeting this week they made a special mention that the reason for success on this project was the partnership as a whole and our ability to work toward their needs no matter what the circumstances.

                <span class="section-number">Section 5</span>
                <h2>Client Impact</h2>
                <p>PNC Financial Services took the following actions based on their satisfaction with the AMG Journey project:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">
                    <li>Presented the series internally as a model design approach for future training partnerships</li>
                    <li>Complimented the team on creativity, professionalism, and quality on numerous occasions</li>
                    <li>Called out the partnership as the primary reason for success during the project debrief</li>
                    <li>Specifically noted the team's ability to work toward their needs regardless of circumstances</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="section-number">Section 6</span>
                <h2>Significance</h2>
                <p>When a client elevates vendor work to the level of an internal model, it represents the highest form of implicit endorsement. PNC was not simply satisfied &mdash; they considered the collaboration process and output worthy of institutional replication. This reflects on the entire team's ability to maintain standards under evolving requirements over an extended engagement.</p>
