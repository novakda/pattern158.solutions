            </div>
            <div class="background-content">
                <p>The BP Learning Platform was a React/GraphQL frontend acting as a federated facade over multiple backend systems: Rustici Content Controller for content playback, PeopleFluent LMS for learning management, Watershed LRS for xAPI analytics, and Amazon Cognito for authentication. Dan worked directly with Rustici Content Controller as an integrator and client-side developer.</p>

                <p>Dan&rsquo;s central challenge was a large-scale multi-tenant rebranding that required navigating the platform&rsquo;s largely undocumented Material UI theming system. Initially scoped as <span class="key-fact">a one-week task</span>, it expanded into <span class="key-fact">a several-month effort</span> as theming complexity revealed deeply interrelated style dependencies across the entire component library. This was Dan&rsquo;s first brownfield project with well-organized engineering practices (JIRA, defined acceptance criteria) from the acquired Leo Learning group.</p>

                <p>The platform was built by the Leo Learning team before GP Strategies acquired them &mdash; Dan joined as a developer on an existing, well-architected system. But the architectural pattern was immediately familiar: another federated integration layer stitching <span class="key-fact">multiple backend systems</span> through a single frontend, echoing the CSBB Dispatch approach Dan had built <span class="key-fact">a decade earlier</span>. He recognized the pattern because he&rsquo;d invented his own version of it in 2011.</p>

                <p>The BP Learning Platform exemplifies federated system integration &mdash; the architectural challenge of making multiple independent systems behave as a coherent whole. The platform&rsquo;s React/GraphQL frontend served as a unifying facade over Rustici Content Controller (content playback), PeopleFluent LMS (learning management), Watershed LRS (xAPI analytics), and Amazon Cognito (authentication).</p>
                <p>The rebranding challenge exposed a truth about brownfield integration work: when systems are undocumented and deeply interrelated, every change becomes an archaeological expedition. Material UI&rsquo;s theming cascades meant that modifying one component&rsquo;s appearance could ripple through dozens of others in unpredictable ways. The only reliable approach was systematic exploration &mdash; the same forensic methodology Dan applied to SCORM protocol debugging and LMS architecture analysis throughout his career.</p>

                <p>The architectural through-line is the most significant observation: CSBB Dispatch (2011) and the BP Learning Platform (2024) represent the same architectural pattern <span class="key-fact">thirteen years apart</span> &mdash; a unifying integration layer that makes multiple backend systems behave as one. Dan built the 2011 version from scratch; he worked inside the 2024 version as a developer. In 2011, it was EasyXDM bridging SCORM content servers and client LMS platforms. In 2024, it was React/GraphQL bridging Rustici, PeopleFluent, Watershed, and Cognito. Different authors, same pattern. Dan recognized it because he&rsquo;d invented his own version of it.</p>
