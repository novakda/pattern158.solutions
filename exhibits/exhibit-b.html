                    <p>The GP Strategies management chain included the Director of Learning Technologies, who relayed feedback from multiple independent sources after both visits; the Sr. Director of Learning Solutions, who served as executive sponsor authorizing the on-site trips and brought 15+ years of GP Strategies leadership; and the Senior Vice President of Learning Solutions, who initiated the EB engagement in September 2017 and independently praised Dan's work.</p>

                    <p>On the Electric Boat side, the Chief of Learning Services served as primary client contact and authored internal EB leadership summaries after both visits. The GP Strategies on-site EB team (3 members) independently relayed positive feedback to the Director following the April 2019 visit.</p>
