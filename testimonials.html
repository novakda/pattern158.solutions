                    Dan Novak "The Fiddler" (Automation) &mdash; Dan gets this name not only because he makes extensive use of the Fiddler application to help us troubleshoot communications errors for customers, but because he fiddles with stuff until we get a tool that makes things&hellip; possible. He also used Fiddler to figure out how to automate the publishing process out of Xyleme. <strong>This resulted in a savings of about 600 hours of labor</strong> by allowing us to publish large batches of lessons unattended.
