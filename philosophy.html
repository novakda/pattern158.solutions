                <dd>
                    <p><strong>The outcome.</strong> Enter chaos, deliver understanding. Legacy systems, undefined requirements, failing courses — hand Dan a mess, get back clarity.</p>

                <dt>2. I Cheat, But I Cheat Fair</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p><strong>The method.</strong> Build tools that skip tedium through proper engineering — documented, maintainable, ethical optimization.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p><strong>The approach.</strong> Don't solve individual problems; prevent entire categories of problems.</p>

                <dd>

                <dd>
                    <p><strong>The creative application.</strong> Tool-assisted optimization applied to professional work — understand the rules deeply, then build tools that operate beyond manual precision.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: How I Work (PHIL-02) -->
        <section id="how-i-work" class="content-section">
            <h2>How I Work</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The three-step pattern that repeats across every project:</p>

            <ol class="methodology-steps">
                <li>
                    <h3>Deconstruct the Chaos</h3>
                    <p>I use forensic engineering to understand "black box" legacy systems. Never blame the human first — investigate the design. Systems thinking over code debugging.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Build the Tool</h3>
                    <p>I create reusable frameworks (middleware, CMS templates, AI agents) to solve the root cause. Don't just fix individual bugs — prevent entire categories of problems.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Empower the User</h3>
                    <p>I hand off robust tools that make complex processes feel simple. Documented, maintainable, and built to outlast my involvement.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="methodology-note">This isn't marketing copy — it's the actual pattern from GM course completion investigation, CSBB Dispatch, SCORM Debugger, Ready2Role rescue, and Power Platform analysis.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Pattern 158 Origin (PHIL-03) -->
        <section id="pattern158-origin" class="content-section">
            <h2>Pattern 158 Origin</h2>

            <div class="origin-story">
                <p>The name comes from a puzzle in <em>Myst</em> — the 1993 point-and-click adventure game that defined a generation of puzzle enthusiasts.</p>

                <p>Near the end of the game, the brothers Sirrus and Achenar whisper a clue: <em>"The final page is in the fireplace... Pattern 158."</em> You find the pattern book in the library, turn to page 158, and enter the pattern on the fireplace grid. The wall rotates to reveal a hidden chamber.</p>

                <p>But here's the twist: the brothers are <em>manipulating</em> you. They're trapped in prison books, and they want you to retrieve their final pages so they can escape. They warn you not to touch the green book — because inside it is their father Atrus, and he knows the truth about their treachery.</p>

                <p><strong>Pattern 158 = the code that reveals both the trap AND the true solution.</strong></p>

                <p>That's how I approach engineering problems. The obvious answer (the red and blue pages) is often a trap. The real solution (the green book) is sitting right next to it — you just have to see through the manipulation to find it. The Myst reference signals pattern-recognition thinking to fellow geeks, while "solutions" keeps it professional for business contexts.</p>

                <p class="domain-note">The domain strategy: <strong>pattern158.solutions</strong> (primary), pattern158.dev (catches developers), pattern158.com (catches default searches). All point to the same portfolio.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Five Core Influences (PHIL-04) -->
        <section id="influences" class="content-section">
            <h2>Five Core Influences</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">These aren't abstract inspirations — they're specific sources that shaped how I think about engineering problems.</p>

            <article class="influence">
                <h3>1. Air Crash Investigation Methodology</h3>
                <p><strong>Sources:</strong> Mayday (Air Crash Investigation TV), Mentour Pilot (YouTube), 74 Gear (YouTube)</p>
                <p><strong>What it taught:</strong> Never blame the human first — look at system design. The Swiss cheese model: disasters require multiple contributing factors aligning. Root cause vs. proximate cause. How bad design sets people up to fail.</p>
                <p><strong>Career application:</strong> The GM course completion investigation is the textbook example. GM reported a 4x spike in incomplete courses and assumed it was a tracking bug. I ran an NTSB-style investigation — technical forensics (Fiddler, browser debugging), UX analysis, user interviews. The root cause wasn't a single bug; it was a perfect storm of fragile architecture, confusing navigation, and sales reps taking training on poor WiFi between customer meetings.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="influence">
                <h3>2. Speedrunning / TASBot Culture</h3>
                <p><strong>Sources:</strong> TASBot demonstrations, tool-assisted speedruns, emulator save states</p>
                <p><strong>What it taught:</strong> Save states for instant replay. Frame-perfect optimization. Tool-assisted mastery — using tools to understand and optimize a system beyond what manual work can achieve.</p>
                <p><strong>Career application:</strong> The SCORM Debugger is the direct embodiment — "TASBot for eLearning." Testing gated courses meant manually clicking through every section to reach the part you needed to test. Hours per cycle. I built a Vue.js wrapper with a fake SCORM API: save course state at any point, restore it instantly, edit SCORM values directly, jump to any section. Testing cycles dropped from hours to seconds. Pure speedrunning methodology applied to professional work.</p>

            <article class="influence">
                <h3>3. The Three Stooges Philosophy</h3>
                <p><strong>Source:</strong> "Tassels in the Air" (1938) — "I cheat, but I cheat fair"</p>
                <p><strong>What it taught:</strong> The distinction between clever shortcuts and corner-cutting. Working smarter through knowledge, not by bypassing rules.</p>
                <p><strong>Career application:</strong> Every tool I build "cheats" by automating tedium, but "fairly" because the output is proper, documented, maintainable engineering. The CSBB Dispatch framework cheated by eliminating manual zip-file email chains, but fairly because it was proper CORS engineering, version-controlled, and production-grade. The SCORM Debugger cheated by bypassing hours of manual clicking, but fairly because it generated legitimate SCORM API responses. This philosophy is the brand tagline for Pattern 158.</p>

            <article class="influence">
                <h3>4. Mentour Pilot's AI App</h3>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> ~2022-2023 (2-3 years before my own AI work)</p>
                <p><strong>What it showed:</strong> A domain expert (commercial airline pilot) building an AI assistant that made his expertise accessible and practically useful — not AI hype, but actual utility.</p>
                <p><strong>Career application:</strong> This planted the seed for AI as a practical work tool. When the Power Platform project landed with departed vendors and undefined requirements, the Mentour Pilot model was already in my head: domain expert + AI assistant = force multiplier. GitHub Spec Kit became my version — using AI to pressure-test intuition and confirm foundational gaps. It's not about replacing human judgment; it's about augmenting it with systematic analysis.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="influence">
                <h3>5. Harry Potter Fanfic Quote</h3>
                <p><strong>Source:</strong> "I seek knowledge not for gain, but to better understand myself" — password to the Department of Mysteries in a Harry Potter fanfic</p>
                <p><strong>What it taught:</strong> The purest motivation for learning. Knowledge pursued for understanding, not advantage.</p>
                <p><strong>Career application:</strong> I don't learn Power Platform to pad my resume; I learn it to understand where its boundaries are. I don't reverse-engineer Ready2Role just to fix bugs; I do it to understand the mind of the engineer who built it. I don't study SCORM specifications to bill more hours; I study them to understand why LMS vendors interpret the spec differently. The knowledge isn't the goal — the understanding is. This quote (and the accompanying concept of "The Machine to Undo Time After Disaster") became two of the six brand elements.</p>
