                    <p>Yes, I'm currently available for contract, contract-to-hire, or full-time positions. I was laid off from GP Strategies in January 2026 and am actively seeking new opportunities.</p>
                    <p>I'm particularly interested in roles involving legacy system modernization, LMS/SCORM integration, enterprise system architecture, accessibility remediation (WCAG 2.1 AA+), and AI-assisted development tooling.</p>

                    <p>Remote is ideal. I'm also open to hybrid arrangements in the Portland, OR area (Vancouver, WA specifically). I have 28+ years of experience working effectively with distributed teams across time zones.</p>
                    <p>I'm comfortable with async communication (email, Slack, documentation) and sync collaboration (video calls, pair programming) depending on what the project needs.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, legacy system modernization is a core specialty. I've rescued undocumented systems, reverse-engineered abandoned codebases, and integrated legacy platforms with modern architectures.</p>
                    <p>See the <a href="index.html#work">portfolio</a> for examples like Ready2Role CMS rescue and CSBB Dispatch framework.</p>

                    <p>Yes. I've designed agentic workflows using GitHub Spec Kit, built Copilot Studio agents for Microsoft, and use AI-assisted development extensively (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code).</p>
                    <p>I focus on practical applications - tools that solve real problems, not hype. AI is most valuable for documentation generation, code review assistance, and rapid prototyping.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>I prioritize clear, documented communication. I'm comfortable with async (email, Slack, documentation) and sync (video calls, pair programming) depending on what the project needs.</p>
                    <p>I'm in US Pacific timezone (Portland, OR). I respond to messages during business hours and document key decisions so distributed teams can stay aligned.</p>

                    <p>Yes. I've spent 28 years working with distributed teams across time zones. I understand the importance of documentation, clear handoffs, and async-first workflows.</p>
                    <p>I'm experienced with collaborative tools (Jira, Confluence, GitHub, Teams, Slack) and know how to keep projects moving when team members are in different locations.</p>

                <summary>What's your approach to unclear requirements?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>I treat it as a forensic investigation. When requirements are undefined or contradictory, I document what exists, map the gaps, and propose solutions grounded in evidence.</p>
                    <p>See the <a href="index.html#work">Power Platform project</a> for an example where I discovered undocumented workflows and rebuilt them systematically. If you have an unclear situation, <a href="contact.html">let's talk</a> - this is exactly the kind of problem I'm good at solving.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Are you comfortable working independently?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Very. I've often been "the engineer" on projects - the one who figures things out, builds the tool, and hands off documentation. I'm self-directed but also collaborate well when the project calls for it.</p>
                    <p>I thrive in situations where requirements are unclear, documentation is missing, or the problem hasn't been solved before. Give me a complex puzzle and I'll map it, solve it, and document it.</p>

            <details open>
                <summary>What's your typical workflow?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The pattern repeats across my career:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Deconstruct the Chaos:</strong> Forensic investigation to understand the system - map dependencies, identify patterns, document what exists</li>
                        <li><strong>Build the Tool:</strong> Create reusable frameworks to solve root causes, not symptoms - automate repetitive tasks, standardize processes</li>
                        <li><strong>Empower the User:</strong> Hand off robust, documented tools that make complex processes simple - clear READMEs, inline comments, training materials</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This pattern shows up whether I'm debugging SCORM packages, reverse-engineering legacy systems, or building automation tools.</p>

            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How do you approach troubleshooting?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Systems thinking first. I look for patterns, examine multiple angles (technical, UX, user behavior), and verify hypotheses with evidence. I document findings clearly so others can follow the reasoning.</p>
                    <p>I'm methodical: reproduce the issue, isolate variables, test hypotheses, fix root cause (not symptoms), verify the fix, and document for future reference.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Do you write documentation?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, extensively. I believe tools are only as good as their documentation. I write clear READMEs, inline code comments, architecture decision records (ADRs), and handoff guides.</p>
                    <p>Documentation isn't an afterthought - it's part of the deliverable. If I build it, I document it so the next person (or future me) can understand and maintain it.</p>
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What's your philosophy on tool selection?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>"Right tool for the job." I'm pragmatic - native solutions over frameworks when possible, established libraries over hand-rolled, simple over clever.</p>
                    <p>I evaluate tools based on: Does it solve the actual problem? Will the team be able to maintain it? Is it overengineered? I'd rather use a boring, reliable solution than chase the latest trend. See the <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy page</a> for more on this approach.</p>
