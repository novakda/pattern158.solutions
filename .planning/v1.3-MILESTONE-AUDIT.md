# Milestone v1.3: GitHub Profile Brand Alignment — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Score:** 15/17 requirements satisfied
**Milestone Goal:** Align the GitHub profile (github.com/novakda) with the professional identity established on pattern158.solutions — update bio, create profile README, curate repos, and link the website.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 20: Repository Metadata & Discoverability (COMPLETE)

| FORK-01 | Hobby/personal forks archived (~25 repos) | Phase 21: SATISFIED | 21-01: Complete | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| FORK-02 | eLearning-relevant forks kept visible | Phase 21: SATISFIED | 21-01: Complete | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

### Phase 22: Strategic Pinning & Final Integration (NOT STARTED)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Claims | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| PIN-01 | 3-6 repos pinned in strategic order | — (no Phase 22) | — | [ ] Pending | **orphaned** |
| PIN-02 | pattern158.solutions pinned in position 1 | — (no Phase 22) | — | [ ] Pending | **orphaned** |

### Orphan Detection

2 requirements are present in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table but absent from ALL phase VERIFICATION.md files:

- **PIN-01** — assigned to Phase 22, which has not been started (no directory, no plans, no verification)
- **PIN-02** — assigned to Phase 22, which has not been started (no directory, no plans, no verification)

Per audit rules: orphaned requirements are treated as unsatisfied. This forces `gaps_found` status.

## Phase Verification Summary (3/4)

| Phase | Status | Score | Requirements | Verified |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 19: Profile Foundation & Brand Voice | human_needed | 9/10 truths | 8/8 SATISFIED | 2026-02-22 |
| 20: Repository Metadata & Discoverability | passed | 9/9 truths | 5/5 SATISFIED | 2026-02-23 |
| 21: Fork Curation & Visibility Strategy | passed | 6/6 truths | 2/2 SATISFIED | 2026-02-22 |
| 22: Strategic Pinning & Final Integration | NOT STARTED | — | 0/2 | — |

## Cross-Phase Integration (17/17)

**Status:** PASSED — all cross-phase connections verified

### Phase Handoffs

| From | To | Connection | Status |
|------|----|-----------|--------|
| Phase 19 (bio domain terms) | Phase 20 (repo descriptions) | Terminology consistency (SCORM/xAPI, accessibility) | WIRED |
| Phase 19 (website URL) | Phase 20 (flagship homepage) | URL reused in repo metadata | WIRED |
| Phase 19 (brand positioning) | Phase 20 (evaluator framing) | Investigative tone consistency | WIRED |
| Phase 20 (fork descriptions) | Phase 21 (archiving) | Descriptions preserved through archive | WIRED |
| Phase 20 (fork topics) | Phase 21 (archiving) | Topics preserved through archive | WIRED |
| Phase 20 (public repo count: 8) | Phase 21 (repo count: 8) | Count stability maintained | WIRED |

### Brand Voice Consistency: ALIGNED

- Phase 19: "Provider of Clarity", NTSB methodology, domain expertise
- Phase 20: Evaluator/researcher framing, domain-specific topic separation
- Phase 21: Archive as "evaluated and preserved" signal, not "abandoned"

No brand voice breaks across phases.

## E2E Flow Verification (4/4)

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Hiring Manager Discovery | Profile search → bio → README → repos → website | COMPLETE (7/7 steps) |
| Accessibility Professional Discovery | Topic search → fork → bio → README skills → flagship topics | COMPLETE (5/5 steps) |
| eLearning Recruiter Discovery | Topic search → forks → evaluator framing → bio → case studies | COMPLETE (6/6 steps) |
| GitHub Search Discoverability | Topic searches for scorm/elearning/wcag/accessibility/portfolio | COMPLETE (5/5 searches) |

## Tech Debt (3 items across 2 phases)

### Phase 19: Profile Foundation & Brand Voice
- Human verification needed: pronouns field display on GitHub profile (API does not expose this field)
- Human verification needed: LinkedIn social link display on GitHub profile sidebar (API does not expose social accounts)

### Phase 21: Fork Curation & Visibility Strategy
- Human judgment needed: professional profile aesthetic assessment (user checkpoint approved but subjective)

**Note:** All 3 tech debt items are human-verification gaps caused by GitHub API limitations, not missing functionality. User confirmed completion during execution.

## Data Integrity

| Metric | Phase 20 | Phase 21 | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Public repos | 8 | 8 | CONSISTENT |
| Archived repos | 0 | 5 | EXPECTED |
| Active forks | 6 | 1 (get-shit-done) | EXPECTED |
| Descriptions intact | 8/8 | 8/8 | PRESERVED |
| Topics intact | 7/8 repos | 7/8 repos | PRESERVED |
| Audit trail | before + after state | before + after state | COMPLETE |

## Unsatisfied Requirements

2 unsatisfied requirements — both in Phase 22 (not yet started):

- **PIN-01: 3-6 repos pinned in strategic order** (Phase 22) — No phase directory, no plans, no execution
- **PIN-02: pattern158.solutions pinned in position 1** (Phase 22) — No phase directory, no plans, no execution
