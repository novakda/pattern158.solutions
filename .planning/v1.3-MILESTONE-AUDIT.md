## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Plans | Requirements | Verified |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 19. Profile Foundation & Brand Voice | ✓ Complete | 2/2 | 8/8 satisfied | 2026-02-22 |
| 20. Repository Metadata & Discoverability | Not started | 0/TBD | 0/5 | — |
| 21. Fork Curation & Visibility Strategy | Not started | 0/TBD | 0/2 | — |
| 22. Strategic Pinning & Final Integration | Not started | 0/TBD | 0/2 | — |

## Integration Check

**Phase 19 wiring:** 5/5 exports properly connected to external GitHub systems
**E2E flows:** 2/2 complete (hiring manager discovery, profile content verification)
**Cross-phase issues:** None — phases 20-22 have no broken dependencies on Phase 19
**Anti-patterns:** None detected

Key integration findings:
- GitHub profile → pattern158.solutions: 5 links wired (bio website field + 4 exhibit links in README)
- pattern158.solutions → GitHub profile: Not wired (website doesn't link back to GitHub — outside milestone scope)
- pattern158.solutions repo metadata is generic (Phase 20 target)

## Unsatisfied Requirements

All 9 unsatisfied requirements are in phases that have not been planned or executed:

- **META-01 through META-05** (Phase 20): Repository metadata updates — descriptions, homepage URL, topics
- **FORK-01, FORK-02** (Phase 21): Fork curation — archive hobby forks, keep eLearning forks
- **PIN-01, PIN-02** (Phase 22): Strategic repo pinning — pin 3-6 repos with pattern158.solutions first

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. Phase 19 has no TODOs, stubs, or deferred items.
