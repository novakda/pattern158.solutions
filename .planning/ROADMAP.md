### 🚧 v1.4 LinkedIn Profile Brand Alignment (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Overhaul LinkedIn profile to match pattern158.solutions quality — optimized for engineering roles broadly, with eLearning as proof-of-depth not pigeonhole.

#### Phase 23: Foundation & Search Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize headline, about section, and custom URL for recruiter search discovery
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Requirements**: PROF-01, PROF-02, PROF-03, PROF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Headline positions Dan as Senior Software Engineer with modern stack (React/TypeScript/Node.js) visible in first 60 characters
  2. About section hook (first 300 chars) establishes engineering-first identity with forensic investigation differentiator
  3. Custom LinkedIn URL claimed (dan-novak or dannovak) and consistent across platforms
  4. Contact email dan@pattern158.solutions visible in Contact Info section and About text
  5. LinkedIn profile appears in recruiter searches for "Senior Software Engineer React" (keyword optimization verified)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 23-01: TBD
- [ ] 23-02: TBD

#### Phase 24: Featured Section & Cross-Platform Linking
**Goal**: Create Featured section with pattern158.solutions exhibits, establishing hub-and-spoke cross-linking
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Requirements**: FEAT-01, FEAT-02, FEAT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Featured section contains 4-6 pattern158.solutions exhibit links (GM Investigation, SCORM Debugger, homepage, philosophy)
  2. Each Featured item has custom title and description optimized for click-through (not default Open Graph text)
  3. Featured section appears above Experience on mobile view (60% of LinkedIn traffic)
  4. Open Graph thumbnails display correctly for all Featured links (visual preview verified)
  5. Cross-platform closed loop verified: LinkedIn → pattern158.solutions → GitHub → LinkedIn (bidirectional links functional)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01: TBD

#### Phase 25: Experience Section Rewrite
**Goal**: Rewrite all experience entries with NTSB structure, modern stack visibility, and layoff framing
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: EXP-01, EXP-02, EXP-03, EXP-04, EXP-05, EXP-06, EXP-07, EXP-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Senior role (2017-2026) showcases 2024-2026 modern work (MCAPS AILT, ContentAIQ, Power Platform analysis) in first 2 bullets
  2. GM Investigation surfaces as forensic engineering differentiator with Challenge → Approach → Solution → Results structure
  3. GP Strategies tenure structured as multiple distinct role entries showing progression (counters single-employer stagnation perception)
  4. Final position includes explicit layoff framing: "Role eliminated as part of company restructuring, January 2026"
  5. All entries use exact formal titles with scope described in text (no title inflation risk)
  6. Experience bullets follow dual-audience pattern: recruiter keywords (React, TypeScript, SCORM, WCAG) AND human storytelling with quantified results
  7. Early career entries (pre-2000) consolidated or omitted to emphasize GP Strategies tenure depth
  8. Every quantifiable claim cross-references pattern158.solutions exhibit (traceability to primary sources maintained)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 25-01: TBD
- [ ] 25-02: TBD
- [ ] 25-03: TBD

#### Phase 26: Skills & Certifications
**Goal**: Replace generic auto-suggested skills with strategic positioning skills, remove weak certifications
**Depends on**: Phase 25
**Requirements**: SKIL-01, SKIL-02, SKIL-03, SKIL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Generic auto-suggested skills removed (Communication, Leadership, Databases, .NET Framework waste skill limit)
  2. Top 3 pinned skills are generalist engineering: System Architecture, React, TypeScript (NOT SCORM/xAPI — counters niche pigeonholing)
  3. Skills list contains 15-25 positioning skills with recruiter exact-match value (React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, SCORM, xAPI, WCAG, SQL, REST APIs, Git)
  4. LinkedIn Learning certifications removed (Vue.js basics, Figma basics signal low-effort padding for senior engineer)
  5. Every skill in top 10 has evidence on pattern158.solutions or GitHub (cross-platform consistency verified)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 26-01: TBD

#### Phase 27: Visual Branding & Contact
**Goal**: Apply visual branding (banner, photo, Open to Work indicator) aligned with pattern158.solutions aesthetic
**Depends on**: Phase 26
**Requirements**: VIS-01, VIS-02, VIS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Banner image created with navy/teal palette aligned to pattern158.solutions NTSB aesthetic (1584x396px verified spec)
  2. Profile photo meets professional quality standard (headshot, neutral background, appropriate framing)
  3. Open to Work indicator configured as recruiter-only (not public green banner — avoids desperation signal)
  4. Visual consistency verified across platforms: LinkedIn banner colors match pattern158.solutions hero and GitHub profile
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 27-01: TBD

#### Phase 28: Recommendations & Polish
**Goal**: Request strategic recommendations, verify mobile display, confirm All-Star completeness
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Requirements**: REC-01, REC-02, REC-03, REC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Recommendation outreach templates drafted for 2-3 strategic asks (GP Strategies manager, technical peer, recent stakeholder beyond Max Glick)
  2. Mobile display tested on phone: headline truncation, about "see more" fold, featured section visibility all verified
  3. All-Star profile completeness achieved (LinkedIn badges profile as complete)
  4. Cross-platform consistency audit passed: LinkedIn ↔ pattern158.solutions ↔ GitHub claims verified non-contradictory
  5. Profile published and ready for recruiter discovery (all 26 requirements satisfied)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: TBD
