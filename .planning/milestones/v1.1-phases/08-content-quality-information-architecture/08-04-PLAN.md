<objective>
Restructure exhibits G through L (6 pages) and verify cross-exhibit consistency across all 11 exhibits. Apply authoritative tone, technology integration, and content quality improvements.

Purpose: Second batch of exhibit restructuring (following Plan 03's A-F). After completing G-L, a consistency check across all 11 exhibits ensures uniform structure, tone, and formatting before the portfolio alignment in Plan 05.

Output: 6 restructured exhibit HTML files, verified cross-exhibit consistency across all 11.

    Read ia-analysis.md exhibit assessments for exhibits G-L. Read each exhibit's current HTML content. Read the Obsidian vault source material for additional context if needed: `/mnt/c/main/Obsidian Vault/CAREER/EmailArchive/Projects/`

    Apply the same editorial framework established in Plan 03:

    **For each exhibit:**
    - Choose structure variant (standard or investigation-inspired) based on story fit
    - Apply "Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" naming
    - Weave technologies into narrative + summary list
    - Use honest results evidence (whatever exists)
    - Depth proportional to story strength
    - Authoritative tone, no passive hedging
    - Cross-references only where genuinely valuable
    - Lessons learned only where meaningful
    - Simple diagrams where they clarify
    - Caution with proprietary information

    **Exhibit consolidation assessment:**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: audit should assess whether any of the 11 exhibits could be stronger combined
    - If ia-analysis.md recommended any consolidations, implement them here (combine the weaker exhibit's content into the stronger one, remove the weaker page)
    - If consolidating: ensure no internal links break, note in SUMMARY which exhibits were consolidated

    **HTML preservation:** Maintain existing section structure, CSS classes, and IDs that the stylesheet depends on. Can add new sections/classes but don't remove existing structural containers. Keep all design token references in inline styles.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All 6 exhibit HTML files render correctly
    - Each exhibit has investigation-style structure
    - Each exhibit title follows naming convention
    - Technology summary sections present in all exhibits
    - Any consolidation decisions documented
    - No CSS class or ID breakage
  </verify>
  <done>
    Exhibits G, H, I, J, K, L restructured using NTSB investigation model with per-exhibit structure variants. Authoritative tone applied. Technology integration complete. Any consolidation recommendations from ia-analysis.md implemented.

    After completing Task 1, scan all 11 exhibits for consistency. Read Plan 03's SUMMARY to understand the patterns established for A-F, then verify G-L matches.

    **Consistency checks:**
    - Consistent heading hierarchy usage (same heading levels for same structural elements)
    - Consistent technology summary section placement (same position relative to other sections)
    - Consistent tone (no exhibit should feel markedly different in voice)
    - Cross-references are reciprocal where appropriate (if A references G, check if G should reference A)
    - Consistent naming convention ("Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" on all 11)

    **Fix any inconsistencies found.** Only make targeted corrections — do not re-restructure exhibits, just align formatting, heading levels, and section ordering for uniformity.

    **Redundancy check across exhibits:**
    - Identify content repeated across multiple exhibits
    - For each: determine if the repetition adds context on that page (keep as intentional echo) or is lazy duplication (remove)
    - Document decisions in SUMMARY
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Heading hierarchy consistent across all 11 exhibits
    - Technology summary section appears in same relative position in all exhibits
    - Tone reads consistently across random spot-checks (read first paragraph of 3 random exhibits)
    - All cross-references are valid (href paths resolve)
    - No CSS class or ID breakage from consistency fixes
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 11 exhibits verified for cross-exhibit consistency. Heading hierarchy, technology section placement, tone, and naming convention uniform. Redundancy assessed and documented. Any inconsistencies fixed.
