Purpose: Complete the color system with accessible, distinguishable links and verify the full color system visually.
Output: Updated css/main.css with finalized link styling; human-verified color quality.

  <action>
  Ensure body content links are visually distinct from surrounding body text using WCAG best practices. Links must be distinguishable by more than color alone (WCAG 1.4.1).

  **Base link styling (body content):**
  Currently, there is no base `a` element styling for body content links. The CSS only styles links within specific components (nav a, footer a, .btn, etc.). Add base body content link styles that:
  1. Use --color-primary for link color (already teal, distinct from body text)
  2. Add text-decoration: underline for non-color distinction (WCAG 1.4.1 compliance)
  3. Add hover state that removes or changes underline style for feedback
  4. Ensure the link color (teal) passes 4.5:1 contrast on --color-background and --color-surface in both modes (this should already pass after Plan 01 fixes)

  **Important:** Only apply underline to body content links. Do NOT add underlines to:
  - Navigation links (nav a) — already styled with no underline, hover color change
  - Buttons (.btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-social) — already styled
  - Footer links (footer a) — already styled with no underline, hover underline
  - Logo link (nav .logo-link) — image, not text
  - Skip link (.skip-link) — utility link
  - Exhibit links (.exhibit-link) — card-style links
  - Back links (.back-link) — styled as nav-like links
  - Email links (.email-link) — already styled

  Strategy: Add base `a` styles within the `@layer base` block with underline, then ensure all component/page layer links that should NOT have underlines already have `text-decoration: none` set (they should from existing code). The cascade layer ordering (base < components < pages) ensures component overrides take precedence.

  **Nav links (dark background context):**
  Nav links already use --color-inverse-text (cream on navy). Verify this is sufficient. The nav a:hover already uses --color-primary. After Plan 01 teal adjustments, verify this hover color passes 3:1 on --color-inverse background.

  **Footer links:**
  Footer links use --color-primary on --color-text background (dark gray). Verify this passes contrast after Plan 01 adjustments. The existing pattern (no underline, hover adds underline) is appropriate.

  **Body content links in dark mode:**
  --color-primary on dark mode --color-background and --color-surface must pass 4.5:1. If Plan 01 adjusted teal for dark mode contrast, the link color automatically benefits. Add a --color-link token if the optimal link color in dark mode differs from --color-primary (but only if necessary — prefer using --color-primary directly for consistency).

  **Visited link evaluation:**
  Per the CONTEXT.md discussion, evaluate whether visited link states add value. For a portfolio site with mostly internal navigation, visited states likely add visual noise without navigation benefit. Decision: skip visited link styling (leave browser default suppressed by color override).

  **Color distribution assessment (60-30-10):**
  Review the overall color usage pattern across the CSS:
  - 60%: Backgrounds (cream/navy in respective modes) — verify this is the dominant visual
  - 30%: Content areas (white/surface cards, text) — verify appropriate proportion
  - 10%: Accents (teal primary, gold accent) — verify these appear sparingly for emphasis

  This is an evaluation, not strict enforcement. If the distribution feels balanced and professional, document it. If any specific pages seem off-balance, note which ones and why, but do not make layout changes (out of scope).

  Add a brief comment in the CSS documenting the color distribution principle.

  1. Verify base link underline only applies to body content, not to nav/button/component links:
     - Grep for text-decoration in CSS to confirm component links still have text-decoration: none
     - Check that base a style has text-decoration: underline within @layer base
  2. Verify link color contrast passes in both modes using the contrast calculator from Plan 01
  3. CSS parses without errors
  </verify>
  <done>Body content links are visually distinct from body text via both color and underline. Nav, footer, button, and component links maintain their existing non-underline styling. Link contrast passes WCAG AA in all contexts.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Human verification of color system across all pages</name>
  <files>css/main.css</files>
  <action>
  Human verifies the complete color system refinement visually:
  - All color token pairs verified for WCAG AA contrast in both light and dark modes (Plan 01)
  - Dark mode verified as navy-based with clear surface elevation (Plan 01)
  - Text-level tokens evaluated and consolidated/documented (Plan 01)
  - Body content links styled with underline + teal color for visual distinction (Plan 02, Task 1)
  - Color distribution evaluated against 60-30-10 principle (Plan 02, Task 1)

  Open the site locally and check the following:

  **Light mode checks:**
  1. Visit index.html — verify body text is readable, headings are clear, teal accents are visible but not overwhelming
  2. Visit any exhibit page (exhibits/exhibit-a.html) — verify body text links are underlined and teal, distinct from surrounding text
  3. Check footer — links should be teal without underline, underline on hover
  4. Check nav — links should be cream/white on navy, teal on hover

  **Dark mode checks (toggle theme):**
  5. Visit index.html — verify navy background (not black), text is readable, cards have visible surface elevation
  6. Visit any exhibit page — verify links are readable and distinct on dark background
  7. Check that inverse sections (hero, nav, footer) look cohesive with the dark page background
  8. Check card/panel backgrounds are visibly elevated from page background

  **Cross-page spot check (2-3 pages):**
  9. Visit philosophy.html and faq.html — verify consistent link styling and color balance
  10. Toggle between light and dark on each page — verify both modes feel professional and brand-consistent

  **What to look for:**
  - Text readability (nothing feels washed out or too dim)
  - Link visibility (can you tell what's clickable?)
  - Dark mode identity (navy NTSB feel, not generic dark theme)
  - Color balance (not too much teal/gold, backgrounds dominate, accents are accents)
  </action>
  <verify>Human opens the site and performs the 10 visual checks listed above in both light and dark modes across at least 3 pages (index, exhibit, philosophy/faq).</verify>
  <done>Human approves the color system as readable, accessible, brand-consistent, and visually balanced in both light and dark modes. Type "approved" or describe specific issues.</done>
</task>

1. Body content links have underline + teal color in both modes
2. Component links (nav, buttons, footer, exhibit cards) do NOT have unintended underlines
3. Link contrast passes WCAG AA on all background contexts
4. Human approves visual quality in both light and dark modes
5. Color distribution feels balanced and professional

<success_criteria>
- Links are visually distinct from body text via color AND underline (WCAG 1.4.1)
- Link styling is consistent across all 17 pages (achieved via base styles in cascade)
- Human verifies both modes look professional and brand-consistent
- Color distribution follows 60-30-10 principle (documented, not rigidly enforced)
