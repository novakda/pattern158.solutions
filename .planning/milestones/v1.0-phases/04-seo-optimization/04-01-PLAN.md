<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add SEO meta tags, OG tags, canonical URLs, and JSON-LD to 5 root pages</name>
  <files>index.html, philosophy.html, faq.html, contact.html, testimonials.html</files>
  <action>
For each of the 5 root-level HTML pages, add the following tags inside the existing `<head>` section, immediately AFTER the `<meta name="color-scheme">` tag and BEFORE the theme detection script:

**A) Meta description and author** (unique per page, 150-160 chars):
```html
<meta name="description" content="[UNIQUE DESCRIPTION]">
<meta name="author" content="Dan Novak">
```

Page-specific meta descriptions (write these exactly or improve slightly while keeping 150-160 chars):
- **index.html**: "Dan Novak - Systems architect with 28+ years rescuing enterprise systems. Specializing in legacy system integration, cross-platform solutions, and AI implementation."
- **philosophy.html**: "The philosophy behind Pattern 158 Solutions. How Dan Novak approaches complex system challenges with investigation-driven methodology and five core influences."
- **faq.html**: "Frequently asked questions about hiring Dan Novak. Covers availability, technical expertise, working style, rates, and engagement process for consulting work."
- **contact.html**: "Get in touch with Dan Novak for systems architecture consulting, legacy system rescue, or technical leadership engagements. Based in Portland, OR."
- **testimonials.html**: "Field reports and case studies from Dan Novak's 28+ year career. Evidence from Electric Boat, Wells Fargo, PNC, HSBC, SunTrust, and more."

**B) Open Graph tags** (after meta description):
```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://pattern158.solutions/[PAGE].html">
<meta property="og:title" content="[MATCH EXISTING TITLE TAG]">
<meta property="og:description" content="[SAME AS META DESCRIPTION OR SHORTER VARIANT]">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://pattern158.solutions/assets/images/logos/pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1024">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="559">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Pattern 158 Solutions">
```

Note on og:image: Research identified current images are too small for ideal social sharing (need 1200x630px). Use the existing logo image as a functional placeholder. The width/height values reflect the actual image dimensions (1024x559). This is a known limitation documented in research -- creating a proper social image is out of scope for this phase.

**C) Twitter card tag**:
```html
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
```

**D) Canonical URL** (add as a `<link>` tag near other link tags):
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://pattern158.solutions/[PAGE].html">
```

**E) JSON-LD structured data** (add BEFORE the closing `</head>` tag):

For **index.html ONLY**, add BOTH Person and WebSite schemas:
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Dan Novak",
  "jobTitle": "Senior Software Engineer | Systems Architect",
  "description": "28+ years building and rescuing enterprise systems",
  "email": "xhiris@gmail.com",
  "url": "https://pattern158.solutions",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Portland",
    "addressRegion": "OR"
  },
  "sameAs": [
    "https://linkedin.com/in/dan-novak-5692197"
  ],
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Legacy System Rescue",
    "Cross-Platform Integration",
    "AI Implementation",
    "Systems Architecture",
    "SCORM",
    "xAPI",
    "JavaScript"
  ]
}
</script>
```

For ALL 5 root pages (including index.html), add WebSite schema:
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Pattern 158 Solutions",
  "description": "Dan Novak's professional portfolio - Systems architecture and legacy system rescue",
  "url": "https://pattern158.solutions"
}
</script>
```

**Placement order in head (top to bottom):**
1. charset, viewport, color-scheme (existing)
2. NEW: meta description, meta author
3. NEW: OG tags block
4. NEW: twitter:card
5. theme detection script (existing)
6. preconnect, fonts, CSS links (existing)
7. favicon links (existing)
8. NEW: canonical link (near other link tags)
9. title (existing)
10. NEW: JSON-LD script(s) (last, before closing head)

Do NOT change any existing tags. Do NOT add meta keywords (deprecated). Do NOT add og:image for a non-existent file -- use the actual logo path.

  <name>Task 2: Add SEO meta tags, OG tags, canonical URLs, and JSON-LD to 9 exhibit pages</name>
  <files>exhibits/exhibit-a.html, exhibits/exhibit-b.html, exhibits/exhibit-c.html, exhibits/exhibit-d.html, exhibits/exhibit-e.html, exhibits/exhibit-f.html, exhibits/exhibit-g.html, exhibits/exhibit-h.html, exhibits/exhibit-i.html</files>
  <action>
For each of the 9 exhibit pages in `exhibits/`, add the same tag structure as Task 1 but with exhibit-specific content. Follow the same placement order within `<head>`.

**Important for exhibit pages:**
- og:type should be "article" (not "website") since these are case study pages
- og:url and canonical href must include the `exhibits/` path: `https://pattern158.solutions/exhibits/exhibit-X.html`
- og:image uses the same absolute URL as root pages: `https://pattern158.solutions/assets/images/logos/pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png`

**Page-specific meta descriptions** (unique per exhibit, 150-160 chars):

Read each exhibit page's content to craft accurate descriptions. Use these as starting points (improve based on actual page content):

- **exhibit-a.html**: "Electric Boat LMS Integration: CSBB Dispatch framework enabling cross-domain SCORM delivery. 5 critical resolutions in 2 days on-site at General Dynamics."
- **exhibit-b.html**: "Multi-level leadership recognition from GP Strategies for the Electric Boat technical engagement. Evidence of impact across organizational hierarchy."
- **exhibit-c.html**: "1,216-lesson content refresh automated to save 600+ hours. Custom tooling transformed a manual process into a systematic content migration pipeline."
- **exhibit-d.html**: "Wells Fargo critical client testing engagement. Rapid-response quality assurance preventing deployment failures for a major financial institution."
- **exhibit-e.html**: "PNC AMG Journey client showcase. Enterprise learning platform development demonstrating cross-functional technical leadership and client partnership."
- **exhibit-f.html**: "HSBC IDAM training platform development. International banking compliance training system built to meet global regulatory requirements."
- **exhibit-g.html**: "SunTrust AWARE platform case study. Enterprise-scale learning management system integration for one of the largest US regional banks."
- **exhibit-h.html**: "Metal additive manufacturing course development. Technical training content for advanced manufacturing processes and 3D printing technology."
- **exhibit-i.html**: "TD MIC project investigation report. Technical engagement delivering measurable results for TD Bank's learning technology infrastructure."

**OG title**: Match the existing `<title>` tag content for each page.

**JSON-LD**: Add WebSite schema only (same block as root pages). Do NOT add Person schema to exhibit pages.

**Canonical URL example**: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://pattern158.solutions/exhibits/exhibit-a.html">`

Same rules apply: Do NOT modify existing tags. Use absolute URLs throughout. No meta keywords.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run these checks:
- `grep -c 'meta name="description"' exhibits/exhibit-*.html` -- each should show 1
- `grep -c 'og:url' exhibits/exhibit-*.html` -- each should show 1
- `grep -c 'og:type.*article' exhibits/exhibit-*.html` -- each should show 1
- `grep -c 'application/ld+json' exhibits/exhibit-*.html` -- each should show 1 (WebSite only)
