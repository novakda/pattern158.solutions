<objective>
Verify profile content quality and publish by flipping the novakda/novakda repository from private to public. Complete web-UI-only profile field updates.

Purpose: Human verification gate ensures README brand voice and content quality meet standards before public visibility. Web UI updates complete the profile fields that have no API access.

Output: Publicly visible profile README, complete profile settings including pronouns and LinkedIn.

  <name>Task 1: Verify profile settings and README content</name>
  <files>N/A (verification checkpoint)</files>
  <action>
**What was built (Plan 01):**
1. Updated GitHub profile settings (bio, website, location, company) via API
2. Created novakda/novakda private repository with complete profile README

The README includes: brand headline, professional introduction, tagline with Moe Howard 1938 attribution, skills/domains section, featured projects linking to pattern158.solutions exhibits, and contact/links section with AI acknowledgment.

**Human verification steps:**

Step 1: Review profile settings
1. Visit https://github.com/settings/profile
2. Verify bio text: should contain "28 years", eLearning/SCORM mention, tagline, availability signal
3. Verify Company: "Pattern 158 Solutions"
4. Verify Location: "Remote"
5. Verify Website: "https://pattern158.solutions"

Step 2: Complete web-UI-only updates
1. On https://github.com/settings/profile:
   - Set **Pronouns** to "he/him"
   - Under **Social accounts**, add LinkedIn: `https://linkedin.com/in/dan-novak-5692197`
   - Click "Save" / "Update profile"

Step 3: Review README content
1. Visit https://github.com/novakda/novakda (private repo -- you must be logged in)
2. Read through the README.md and evaluate:
   - Does the brand headline convey "Provider of Clarity" identity?
   - Does the introduction build the competence -> distinction -> value impression?
   - Is the tagline properly attributed (Moe Howard, 1938)?
   - Does the skills section cover eLearning, SCORM, accessibility, systems architecture?
   - Do featured project descriptions have a developer angle (technical challenges, not just business outcomes)?
   - Are exhibit links pointing to correct pattern158.solutions URLs?
   - Is the contact section complete with availability signal?
   - Is the AI acknowledgment present and appropriate?
   - Is the tone slightly warmer than the website but still brand-consistent?
   - Are there no buzzwords (passionate, innovative, thought leader)?
   - Is emoji usage minimal (max 2-3 total)?

Step 4: Check rendered formatting
1. On the repo page, confirm markdown renders correctly (headers, blockquotes, links, horizontal rules)
2. Verify links are clickable and point to correct destinations

**Resume signal:** Type "approved" to proceed with publishing (flip to public), or describe specific content/formatting changes needed.
  </action>
  <verify>Human confirms profile settings are correct and README content meets brand voice and quality standards.</verify>
  <done>Human has reviewed and approved all profile settings and README content. Web-UI-only fields (pronouns, LinkedIn) have been set manually. Ready to flip repo to public.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Flip novakda/novakda repository to public</name>
  <files>N/A (GitHub repository visibility setting)</files>
  <action>
After human approval, flip the profile README repository from private to public:

```bash
gh repo edit novakda/novakda --visibility public
```

Then verify the profile README is now visible on the public profile:

```bash
# Confirm visibility change
gh repo view novakda/novakda --json visibility --jq '.visibility'
# Should output: PUBLIC

# Verify README content is accessible
gh api repos/novakda/novakda/readme --jq '.content' | base64 -d | head -5
```

**Final integration check:**
Visit https://github.com/novakda and confirm:
1. Profile README displays below the profile sidebar
2. Bio text appears in sidebar
3. Website link (pattern158.solutions) appears in sidebar
4. Company (Pattern 158 Solutions) appears in sidebar
5. Location (Remote) appears in sidebar
6. The overall profile creates a cohesive professional impression

If the repo flip succeeds but README doesn't display, verify:
- Repository name exactly matches username: `novakda/novakda`
- README.md is in repository root (not a subdirectory)
- File is named exactly `README.md` (case-sensitive)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `gh repo view novakda/novakda --json visibility --jq '.visibility'` returns "PUBLIC"
2. `gh api repos/novakda/novakda/readme` returns 200 (not 404)
3. Profile page at github.com/novakda shows README content below sidebar
  </verify>
  <done>
novakda/novakda repository is public. Profile README displays on github.com/novakda. Hiring managers visiting the GitHub profile see: professional bio with domain expertise and tagline in sidebar, website link to pattern158.solutions, and a detailed profile README with brand headline, introduction, skills, featured projects, and contact info. The profile creates a cohesive narrative aligned with the pattern158.solutions portfolio.
  </done>
