<objective>
Create the novakda/novakda profile README repository (private) with complete brand-aligned content, and update all GitHub profile settings to reflect the Pattern 158 professional identity.

Purpose: Establish Dan's GitHub presence as a professional extension of pattern158.solutions, creating a cohesive brand experience for hiring managers and engineers who discover the profile.

Output: Private novakda/novakda repo with README.md, updated GitHub profile fields (bio, website, location, pronouns, company).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update GitHub profile settings via API and web UI</name>
  <files>N/A (GitHub profile fields, no local files)</files>
  <action>
Update GitHub profile fields to establish professional identity. Use `gh api` for fields that support it, and document web UI instructions for fields that require manual updates.

**API-updatable fields (execute via CLI):**

```bash
gh api --method PATCH /user \
  -f bio="28 years building eLearning systems (SCORM/xAPI) and accessible platforms. Open to opportunities. I cheat, but I cheat fair." \
  -f company="Pattern 158 Solutions" \
  -f location="Remote" \
  -f blog="https://pattern158.solutions" \
  -F hireable=true
```

Bio composition rules (LOCKED decisions):
- Lead with "28 years" domain experience framing with eLearning specificity
- Include SCORM/xAPI tech mentions
- Include tagline "I cheat, but I cheat fair"
- Include availability signal
- No buzzwords (passionate, innovative, thought leader)
- Must be <= 160 characters

The example bio above is 127 characters. Claude MAY adjust wording for better impact as long as all locked constraints are met and it stays under 160 characters. Character count MUST be verified before submission.

**Web UI fields (document for human action in Plan 02):**
- Pronouns: he/him (cannot be set via API)
- Social accounts > LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/dan-novak-5692197

After API update, verify with:
```bash
gh api /user --jq '{name, bio, company, location, blog, hireable}'
```

Confirm:
- bio contains "28 years", "eLearning", "SCORM/xAPI", "cheat", availability signal
- bio is <= 160 characters
- company = "Pattern 158 Solutions"
- location = "Remote"
- blog = "https://pattern158.solutions"
- hireable = true
  </action>
  <verify>Run `gh api /user --jq '{name, bio, company, location, blog, hireable}'` and confirm all fields match expected values. Count bio characters to verify <= 160.</verify>
  <done>GitHub profile bio reflects Pattern 158 identity with domain expertise + tagline + availability signal under 160 chars. Website URL points to pattern158.solutions. Location is Remote. Company is Pattern 158 Solutions. hireable is true.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create novakda/novakda repo and write profile README</name>
  <files>novakda/novakda/README.md (external GitHub repo)</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Create the profile README repository (private)**

```bash
gh repo create novakda --private --description "GitHub profile README" --add-readme
gh repo clone novakda/novakda /tmp/novakda-profile
cd /tmp/novakda-profile
```

**Step 2: Write README.md content**

The README must follow these LOCKED decisions from CONTEXT.md:
- Length: Detailed (full professional profile, not business card)
- Sections: Intro + philosophy, Skills/domains, Featured projects, Contact + links
- Tone: Match website voice but slightly warmer for GitHub community
- Tagline: Full attribution -- "I cheat, but I cheat fair" -- Moe Howard, 1938
- AI/Claude acknowledgment: Include (fits "cheat fair" philosophy)
- Core impression sequence: Competence -> Distinction -> Value
- Feature career exhibits from pattern158.solutions (NOT GitHub repos)
- Developer-oriented descriptions (technical challenges and solutions)
- Availability signal in README (consistent with bio)
- No buzzwords, no emoji overload

**README structure (mandatory sections per CONTEXT.md):**

1. **Brand headline** (README-02): Use "Provider of Clarity" identity. Format example:
   ```
   # Dan Novak -- Provider of Clarity
   ```
   Claude's discretion on exact phrasing. Must align with Pattern 158 identity.

2. **Professional introduction** (README-03): 2-3 sentences establishing competence + distinction. Must mention:
   - 28 years of experience
   - eLearning systems architecture specialization
   - Legacy system rescue / forensic debugging angle
   - The distinction factor (NTSB methodology, unconventional approach)

3. **Tagline block**: Include with full attribution:
   ```
   > "I cheat, but I cheat fair."
   > -- Moe Howard, *The Three Stooges*, 1938
   ```

4. **Skills/domains section** (README-04): Must cover eLearning, SCORM, accessibility, systems architecture. Claude's discretion on format (grouped, flat, or narrative). Research recommends narrative (Option 3) as most aligned with Pattern 158 voice.

5. **Featured projects section** (README-05): Feature career exhibits from pattern158.solutions with developer-angle descriptions. Research recommends 3-4 strongest:
   - Exhibit M (SCORM Debugger): Vue.js wrapper, SCORM API emulation, save state architecture
   - Exhibit E (Cross-Domain SCORM): CORS middleware, iframe sandboxing, 5 years before commercial product
   - Exhibit J (GM Investigation): Swiss cheese model forensics, multi-angle root cause analysis
   - Exhibit N (BP Learning Platform): Rustici Content Controller integration, reverse-engineered undocumented platform

   Each exhibit should have: title, 2-3 sentence developer-angle description, link to pattern158.solutions exhibit page.

6. **Contact/links section** (README-06): Include:
   - Link to pattern158.solutions
   - Availability signal (consistent phrasing with bio)
   - LinkedIn link
   - AI acknowledgment footer (Claude's discretion on prominence -- research recommends footer note)

**Brand intensity calibration** (from RESEARCH.md):
- 60% NTSB aesthetic, 40% GitHub native
- Use horizontal rules for section breaks
- Title Case headers (not ALL CAPS)
- Blockquotes for tagline (optional stylistic choice)
- Minimal emoji (max 2-3 in entire README)
- Monospace or emphasis for technical terms where appropriate

**Step 3: Commit and push**

```bash
cd /tmp/novakda-profile
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add profile README with Pattern 158 brand identity"
git push
```

**Step 4: Verify README renders on GitHub**

```bash
gh api repos/novakda/novakda/readme --jq '.content' | base64 -d | head -20
```

Confirm content is present and starts with expected headline.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `gh repo view novakda/novakda --json name,visibility` confirms repo exists and is private
2. `gh api repos/novakda/novakda/readme --jq '.content' | base64 -d` shows full README content
3. README contains all required sections: headline, intro, tagline with attribution, skills/domains, featured projects with exhibit links, contact/links
4. README links point to valid pattern158.solutions URLs
5. Tagline includes "Moe Howard" and "1938" attribution
6. No buzzwords (passionate, innovative, thought leader)
7. Availability signal present in README
  </verify>
  <done>
novakda/novakda repository exists (private) with README.md containing: brand headline, professional introduction, tagline with full Moe Howard 1938 attribution, skills/domains section, featured projects with pattern158.solutions exhibit links and developer-angle descriptions, contact/links section with availability signal and AI acknowledgment. Tone is slightly warmer than website while maintaining Pattern 158 brand consistency.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `gh api /user --jq '{bio, company, location, blog, hireable}'` returns expected values
2. Bio character count <= 160 and contains all locked elements
3. `gh repo view novakda/novakda --json name,visibility` returns `{"name":"novakda","visibility":"PRIVATE"}`
4. README.md contains all 6 required sections (README-01 through README-06)
5. All pattern158.solutions URLs in README are valid (no 404s)
6. No deferred ideas implemented (none were deferred)
