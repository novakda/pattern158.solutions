<objective>
Update eLearning fork metadata and verify complete profile discoverability.

Purpose: Give every eLearning-relevant fork a custom description that frames Dan as an evaluator/researcher (not practitioner), apply domain-specific topics for GitHub search discoverability, and verify the entire profile is cohesive and professional.

Output: 5 eLearning forks + get-shit-done with updated descriptions and topics, full-profile verification passed.

  <name>Task 1: Check fork histories and update fork descriptions and topics</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
**Step 1 — Check fork commit histories for meaningful modifications:**

For each of the 5 eLearning forks, check whether there are commits ahead of upstream:
```bash
# For each fork, check if there are local commits
for repo in aria-practices wai-tutorials dewordify lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 SCOBot; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh api /repos/novakda/$repo --jq '{fork: .fork, default_branch: .default_branch}'
done
```

Also check get-shit-done:
```bash
gh api /repos/novakda/get-shit-done --jq '{fork: .fork, default_branch: .default_branch, description: .description}'
```

Use the results to inform description framing — repos with meaningful modifications can be described more actively; repos that are pure forks should use "evaluated for" language per user decision.

**Step 2 — Update eLearning fork descriptions:**

Apply descriptions using the hybrid voice: lead with outcome, include tech terms, acknowledge upstream, frame as evaluator/researcher per user decisions. Keep existing upstream homepage URLs as-is per user decision. Use WCAG/formal terminology for standards repos (aria-practices, wai-tutorials), broader "accessibility" language for others.

```bash
# aria-practices — WCAG reference material framing
gh repo edit novakda/aria-practices \
  --description "Fork of w3c/aria-practices — Evaluated as reference for implementing WCAG-compliant interactive components in eLearning platforms"

# wai-tutorials — WCAG reference material framing
gh repo edit novakda/wai-tutorials \
  --description "Fork of w3c/wai-tutorials — Evaluated as reference for implementing WCAG-compliant content patterns in eLearning platforms"

# dewordify — rapid authoring tool evaluation framing
gh repo edit novakda/dewordify \
  --description "Fork of tomjn/dewordify — Evaluated as rapid authoring alternative to WYSIWYG eLearning editors for Word-to-HTML content conversion"

# lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 — SCORM standards research framing
gh repo edit novakda/lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 \
  --description "Fork of nickthedude/lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 — Evaluated as part of SCORM 2004 Edition 3 standards research for LMS content packaging"

# SCOBot — SCORM standards research framing
gh repo edit novakda/SCOBot \
  --description "Fork of cybercussion/SCOBot — Evaluated as part of SCORM API standards research for JavaScript runtime communication libraries"
```

**Step 3 — Assess and update get-shit-done description:**

Check current fork description. Per user decision, "no special framing needed (upstream description is fine, or light touch-up)". The fork is for workflow/productivity, not eLearning — no eLearning framing.

```bash
gh repo view novakda/get-shit-done --json description --jq '.description'
```

If the current description adequately describes the tool, leave it as-is. If it needs a light touch-up for clarity (e.g., removing marketing language), update with something clean:
```bash
# Only if current description needs improvement:
gh repo edit novakda/get-shit-done \
  --description "Fork of gsd-build/get-shit-done — Meta-prompting and spec-driven development framework for Claude Code"
```

**Step 4 — Apply topics to eLearning forks:**

Use the topic replacement API endpoint to set topics cleanly. Apply shared eLearning topics where genuinely relevant — do NOT force "scorm" on accessibility repos per user decision.

For repos that may have existing topics from upstream (especially SCOBot with 20 topics), use the PUT endpoint to replace all topics with a curated set:

```bash
# aria-practices — WCAG/accessibility topics only (no scorm, no elearning)
gh api /repos/novakda/aria-practices/topics \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" \
  -f names[]="accessibility" \
  -f names[]="wcag" \
  -f names[]="aria" \
  -f names[]="wai-aria"

# wai-tutorials — WCAG/accessibility topics only
gh api /repos/novakda/wai-tutorials/topics \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" \
  -f names[]="accessibility" \
  -f names[]="wcag" \
  -f names[]="html" \
  -f names[]="tutorials"

# dewordify — eLearning + authoring topics
gh api /repos/novakda/dewordify/topics \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" \
  -f names[]="elearning" \
  -f names[]="authoring-tools" \
  -f names[]="html" \
  -f names[]="content-conversion"

# lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 — SCORM/LMS topics
gh api /repos/novakda/lms-content-template-scorm2004e3/topics \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" \
  -f names[]="scorm" \
  -f names[]="elearning" \
  -f names[]="lms" \
  -f names[]="scorm2004"

# SCOBot — SCORM/API topics (curated down from 20)
gh api /repos/novakda/SCOBot/topics \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" \
  -f names[]="scorm" \
  -f names[]="elearning" \
  -f names[]="javascript" \
  -f names[]="scorm-api" \
  -f names[]="lms"
```

For get-shit-done, assess whether topics are needed. If current topics are fine, leave them. If no topics, consider adding a few relevant ones (but this is not eLearning-related, so no eLearning topics):
```bash
# Check current topics
gh api /repos/novakda/get-shit-done/topics -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" | jq .names
# Only add/update if genuinely useful for discoverability
```

**Step 5 — Verify each fork's metadata:**
```bash
for repo in aria-practices wai-tutorials dewordify lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 SCOBot get-shit-done; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh repo view novakda/$repo --json description,homepageUrl
  gh api /repos/novakda/$repo/topics -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" | jq .names
done
```

Confirm each fork shows: custom description (not upstream default), appropriate topics, existing homepage URLs preserved.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Each of the 5 eLearning forks has a custom description containing "Fork of" and "Evaluated" (or similar evaluator framing)
2. aria-practices and wai-tutorials descriptions use WCAG/formal accessibility terminology
3. dewordify, lms-content-template-scorm2004e3, and SCOBot descriptions use eLearning/SCORM framing
4. All 5 eLearning forks have 4-5 topics each
5. get-shit-done has been assessed and updated/confirmed
6. No fork has "elearning" topic on non-eLearning repos (aria-practices, wai-tutorials should NOT have elearning topic)
  </verify>
  <done>All 5 eLearning forks have custom descriptions framing Dan as evaluator/researcher, appropriate domain topics applied, get-shit-done assessed. META-05 fully satisfied.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Comprehensive profile verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
**Step 1 — Verify public repo count:**
```bash
gh repo list novakda --visibility public --json name --jq '.[].name' | sort
```
Must return exactly 8 repos: aria-practices, dewordify, get-shit-done, lms-content-template-scorm2004e3, novakda, pattern158.solutions, SCOBot, wai-tutorials.

**Step 2 — Verify all 8 public repos have descriptions:**
```bash
gh repo list novakda --visibility public --json name,description --jq '.[] | "\(.name): \(.description)"' | sort
```
Every repo must have a non-empty description. No repo should show the default upstream description without professional context.

**Step 3 — Verify pattern158.solutions has homepage URL and topics:**
```bash
gh repo view novakda/pattern158.solutions --json description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics
```
Must show: description with "Pattern 158", homepage "https://pattern158.solutions", topics including portfolio, accessibility, wcag, static-site.

**Step 4 — Verify fork descriptions contain evaluator framing:**
```bash
for repo in aria-practices wai-tutorials dewordify lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 SCOBot; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh repo view novakda/$repo --json description --jq '.description'
done
```
Each must contain "Fork of" (or similar upstream acknowledgment) and evaluator/researcher framing.

**Step 5 — Verify topics on all repos with expected topics:**
```bash
for repo in pattern158.solutions aria-practices wai-tutorials dewordify lms-content-template-scorm2004e3 SCOBot; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh api /repos/novakda/$repo/topics -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json" | jq -r '.names | join(", ")'
done
```
Verify topic assignments match the intended strategy: accessibility repos get wcag/accessibility/aria topics, SCORM repos get scorm/elearning/lms topics, portfolio gets portfolio/static-site topics.

**Step 6 — Capture post-change state:**
```bash
gh repo list novakda --limit 200 --json name,isPrivate,isFork,description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics > .planning/phases/20-repository-metadata-discoverability/after-state.json
```

**Step 7 — Summary count verification:**
```bash
echo "Public repos:"
gh repo list novakda --visibility public --json name --jq '. | length'
echo "Private repos:"
gh repo list novakda --visibility private --json name --jq '. | length'
```
Public count should be 8. Private count should be >= 31 (may include previously-private repos).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Exactly 8 public repos confirmed
2. All 8 repos have non-empty descriptions
3. pattern158.solutions has homepage URL and 4 topics
4. All 5 eLearning forks have custom descriptions with evaluator framing
5. All repos with expected topics have them applied
6. after-state.json saved for audit trail
  </verify>
  <done>Complete profile verification passed: 8 curated public repos with professional metadata, 31+ repos private, all descriptions use hybrid voice, topics support GitHub search discoverability. Phase 20 requirements META-01 through META-05 fully satisfied.</done>
</task>
