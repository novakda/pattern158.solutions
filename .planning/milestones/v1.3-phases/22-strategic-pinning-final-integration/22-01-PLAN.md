<objective>
Pin 5 repositories on github.com/novakda in strategic order (pattern158.solutions, novakda, aria-practices, wai-tutorials, SCOBot), verify all bidirectional cross-links between website and GitHub, and close the v1.3 milestone.

Purpose: Complete the GitHub profile brand alignment by curating the profile homepage with strategic pins that tell a cohesive professional narrative — flagship portfolio first, profile introduction second, accessibility depth third, SCORM domain fourth.

Output: Pinned GitHub profile, cross-link verification audit trail, updated milestone documentation.

  <name>Task 1: Verify cross-links and pre-pin readiness</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/22-strategic-pinning-final-integration/cross-link-verification.json</files>
  <action>
Run automated verification of all bidirectional cross-links and repo readiness for pinning. Save results to cross-link-verification.json.

**Website to GitHub links:**
```bash
grep -n "github.com/novakda" contact.html
```
Expected: At least 1 match (Connect section link).

**GitHub to Website links:**
```bash
# Profile bio and website field
gh api /users/novakda --jq '{bio, blog}'
# Expected: blog = "https://pattern158.solutions"

# Flagship repo homepage URL
gh api /repos/novakda/pattern158.solutions --jq '.homepage'
# Expected: "https://pattern158.solutions"

# Profile README references to website
gh api /repos/novakda/novakda/readme --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep -c "pattern158.solutions"
# Expected: 2+ references
```

**Pinning candidates readiness check:**
```bash
# Verify all 5 pin candidates have descriptions and appropriate metadata
for repo in pattern158.solutions novakda aria-practices wai-tutorials SCOBot; do
  gh api /repos/novakda/$repo --jq '{name, description, homepage, topics, archived, fork}'
done
```

**Current pin state:**
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{
  user(login: "novakda") {
    pinnedItems(first: 6, types: REPOSITORY) {
      nodes {
        ... on Repository {
          name
          description
          url
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.user.pinnedItems.nodes'
```
Expected: Empty array (no pins set yet).

Save all verification results to `cross-link-verification.json` with structure:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
  "website_to_github": { "contact_html_links": N, "verified": true/false },
  "github_to_website": { "profile_bio": "...", "profile_blog": "...", "repo_homepage": "...", "readme_references": N, "verified": true/false },
  "pin_candidates": [ { "name": "...", "description": "...", "ready": true } ],
  "current_pins": [],
  "all_cross_links_verified": true/false
}
```

**If any cross-link is missing:** Report it but do NOT attempt to fix it — all links should already exist from Phases 19-20. A missing link would indicate a regression that needs investigation.

  <name>Task 2: Pin 5 repositories via GitHub web UI</name>
  <action>
**No CLI or API exists for repository pinning.** The user must perform this manually.

**Pin these 5 repositories in this exact order:**

| Position | Repository | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | pattern158.solutions | Flagship portfolio — hiring manager's first click leads to live site |
| 2 | novakda | Profile README — professional introduction and brand narrative |
| 3 | aria-practices | W3C ARIA reference — accessibility expertise signal (archived, evaluator framing) |
| 4 | wai-tutorials | W3C accessibility patterns — reinforces accessibility depth (archived, evaluator framing) |
| 5 | SCOBot | SCORM API library — eLearning domain depth signal (archived, evaluator framing) |

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/novakda
2. Click the **"Customize your pins"** link (visible only to profile owner)
3. In the pin selector dialog, check these 5 repos: pattern158.solutions, novakda, aria-practices, wai-tutorials, SCOBot
4. Drag to reorder into the exact sequence above (position 1 = top-left, position 2 = top-right, etc.)
5. Click **"Save pins"**
6. Verify the profile shows the 5 repos in the correct 2x3 grid layout

**Rationale for this order:**
- Positions 1-2: Original repos (portfolio flagship + professional intro)
- Positions 3-4: Accessibility expertise (W3C standards, strongest professional signal)
- Position 5: SCORM domain depth (eLearning systems knowledge)
- Excluded: get-shit-done (lightly customized fork — would dilute professional narrative)

**Why 5 pins (not 6):** 5 high-quality pins with strong narrative > 6 pins with weaker coherence. The 6th slot would be dewordify or lms-content-template (neither adds signal that the first 5 don't already cover).

  <resume-signal>Type "pinned" after completing the steps above, or describe any issues.</resume-signal>

  <name>Task 3: Verify pins and close v1.3 milestone</name>

    .planning/STATE.md

**Step 1: Verify pins via GraphQL API**

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{
  user(login: "novakda") {
    pinnedItems(first: 6, types: REPOSITORY) {
      nodes {
        ... on Repository {
          name
          description
          url
          isFork
          isArchived
          homepageUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.user.pinnedItems.nodes'
```

Verify:
- Exactly 5 repos returned
- Order: pattern158.solutions, novakda, aria-practices, wai-tutorials, SCOBot
- pattern158.solutions has homepageUrl = "https://pattern158.solutions"
- pattern158.solutions is NOT a fork and NOT archived

If verification fails (wrong count, wrong order, missing repos), report the discrepancy but do NOT attempt to fix — pinning is manual only.

**Step 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md**

Mark PIN-01 and PIN-02 as complete:
- `- [ ] **PIN-01**` → `- [x] **PIN-01**`
- `- [ ] **PIN-02**` → `- [x] **PIN-02**`

Update traceability table:
- `| PIN-01 | Phase 22 | Pending |` → `| PIN-01 | Phase 22 | Complete |`
- `| PIN-02 | Phase 22 | Pending |` → `| PIN-02 | Phase 22 | Complete |`

**Step 3: Update ROADMAP.md**

Mark Phase 22 complete:
- `- [ ] **Phase 22: Strategic Pinning & Final Integration**` → `- [x] **Phase 22: Strategic Pinning & Final Integration** (completed DATE)`
- Update plans list with actual plan name
- Update progress table: status = "✓ Complete", plans = "1/1"
- Mark v1.3 milestone as shipped: `✅ **v1.3 GitHub Profile Brand Alignment** — Phases 19-22 (shipped DATE)`

**Step 4: Update STATE.md**

- Update "Current Position" to show Phase 22 complete
- Update progress to 100% (22/22 phases complete)
- Update "Last activity" with today's date
- Add Phase 22 status to Blockers/Concerns section showing all items complete
- Update v1.3 velocity with final totals
- Update "Next step" to indicate milestone complete
- Add `*v1.3 shipped: DATE*` line

Commit: `docs(22-01): verify pins and close v1.3 milestone`
  </action>
  <verify>
Run GraphQL pin verification query — returns 5 repos in correct order. Check REQUIREMENTS.md has `[x]` for PIN-01 and PIN-02. Check ROADMAP.md has Phase 22 marked complete and v1.3 marked shipped. Check STATE.md shows 100% progress.
  </verify>
  <done>Pinned repos verified via API. PIN-01 and PIN-02 requirements marked complete. v1.3 milestone marked shipped in ROADMAP.md and STATE.md. All planning documentation reflects project completion.</done>
