<objective>
Optimize exhibit headlines for impact-first presentation, restructure tables per user decision, and conduct a full visual consistency audit across all 14 exhibits including dark mode and mobile verification.

Purpose: Hiring managers scan exhibits in under 30 seconds. Headlines must communicate outcomes, not just topics. Tables (Personnel Involved, etc.) blend items together and are hard to read — restructure to card-style blocks or definition lists matching exhibit-a's visual patterns. Full visual consistency pass ensures all 14 exhibits look professionally cohesive.

Output: All 14 exhibits with impact-first headlines, restructured tables, visually consistent presentation. Updated testimonials.html and portfolio.html cards. Human verification checkpoint for visual quality.

**Part A: Impact-First Headlines**

For each of the 14 exhibits, review and optimize the h1 and subtitle for impact-first presentation. Headlines should communicate the outcome or business value, not just the topic.

Current headline pattern:
```html
<h1>EXHIBIT X: <span class="pattern-number">PROJECT NAME</span></h1>
<p class="subtitle">Descriptive subtitle</p>
```

Optimize by ensuring:
- The pattern-number span communicates the outcome/impact (e.g., "7-YEAR EMBEDDED ADVISORY" instead of just "ELECTRIC BOAT LMS INTEGRATION")
- The subtitle reinforces the key result or methodology
- Use discretion: some exhibits may benefit from business outcome angles, others from problem-first or domain/role angles (per CONTEXT.md)

**Headline optimization approach per exhibit (use discretion):**
- exhibit-a: Already strong. Verify subtitle conveys outcome.
- exhibit-b: "Leadership Recognition Chain" — consider outcome angle
- exhibit-c: "1,216-Lesson Content Refresh" — already impact-first, verify
- exhibit-d: "100+ Course Technical Lead" — already has scale, verify
- exhibit-e: CSBB Dispatch — Rustici signaling, "5 years before Content Controller"
- exhibit-f: HSBC — cross-platform forensics, verify impact
- exhibit-g: SunTrust AWARE — custom integration, verify impact
- exhibit-h: Metal Additive Manufacturing — cross-functional, verify impact
- exhibit-i: TD Bank Accessibility — compliance scope, verify impact
- exhibit-j: GM Investigation — systemic failure analysis, already strong
- exhibit-k: Career Documentation Refactoring — methodology, verify impact
- exhibit-l: Power Platform Audit — "Diagnosis as Deliverable", already strong
- exhibit-m: SCORM Debugger — TASBot methodology, Rustici gap
- exhibit-n: BP Learning Platform — Rustici Content Controller integration

After changing any exhibit headline, update the corresponding card in testimonials.html and portfolio.html to match. The exhibit-title h3 on testimonials.html and the card content on portfolio.html should reflect the updated framing.

**Part B: Table Restructuring**

Per user decision: restructure tables (Personnel Involved, etc.) away from table format because items blend together and are hard to read. Study exhibit-a's approach to see how it handles personnel (narrative paragraphs in background-content divs rather than tables).

Targets for restructuring:
1. Find all `<table class="personnel-table">` and `<table class="resolution-table">` elements used for personnel/role listings (NOT findings tables — those stay as tables)
2. Replace with card-style blocks or descriptive paragraphs matching exhibit-a's personnel approach:
   - exhibit-a uses narrative paragraphs for personnel — this is the benchmark
   - Alternative: definition list format (`<dl><dt>Role</dt><dd>Description</dd></dl>`) for structured role listings
3. For Findings tables (issue resolution tables with F-01, F-02 numbering): keep as tables — these are data-appropriate
4. For Technology tables: convert to the paragraph format used in exhibit-a section 9 (category bold + inline list) unless the table provides better readability

Add any needed CSS to main.css for restructured components. Keep new CSS minimal — prefer existing classes and patterns.

**Important:** Do NOT restructure findings/resolution tables that present investigation data (F-01, F-02 style). Only restructure personnel/role tables and technology category tables where the table format makes items blend together.
  </action>
  <verify>
- For each exhibit, verify the h1 contains a pattern-number span with impact-first content
- grep -c 'personnel-table' exhibits/exhibit-*.html (should return 0 — all converted)
- Check testimonials.html and portfolio.html card titles still link correctly to each exhibit
- grep 'exhibit-link' testimonials.html | wc -l (should be 14 — one per exhibit)
  </verify>
  <done>
All 14 exhibits have impact-first headlines visible within 30-second scan. Personnel/role tables restructured to card-style or narrative format. Testimonials and portfolio cards updated to match headline changes. Findings/resolution tables preserved.

Conduct a full visual consistency audit across all 14 exhibits. Study exhibit-a to identify what makes it the best-formatted and replicate those patterns.

**Visual consistency checklist (apply to all 14 exhibits):**

1. **Hero section consistency:**
   - All heroes use `<section class="hero">` with container div
   - report-meta div present with consistent fields (Client/Context, Period, Role/Team)
   - classification span at bottom of hero with consistent format

2. **Section spacing:**
   - All sections use `<section class="report-section"><div class="container">`
   - Section heading uses section-heading div pattern (verified by Plans 01/02)
   - Consistent content wrapper usage (background-content div)

3. **Component usage consistency:**
   - Blockquotes use attribution div pattern matching exhibit-a
   - Evidence cards use evidence-grid/evidence-card pattern where applicable
   - Probable cause uses probable-cause-box div
   - Recommendations use recommendations-list ul
   - Impact tags use impact-tags div with impact-tag spans

4. **Typography consistency:**
   - Report-intro paragraphs styled consistently
   - Key-fact spans used for standout metrics
   - Solution-detail paragraphs and speaker spans used consistently

5. **Footer consistency:**
   - All exhibits have back-link-section before footer
   - All footers have identical structure
   - Footer-attribution line present where applicable

6. **Dark mode verification (CRITICAL per user decision):**
   - Start a local HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
   - Use Playwright to screenshot each exhibit in both light and dark modes
   - Verify: text readable, backgrounds correct, blockquotes visible, tables/cards readable, evidence cards have proper contrast, impact tags visible
   - Fix any dark mode issues found (typically missing dark theme token usage)

7. **Mobile responsiveness verification (per user decision — not deferred):**
   - Use Playwright at 375px viewport width to verify each exhibit
   - Check: section headings don't overflow, tables responsive (card transform), timeline entries readable, evidence grid stacks properly, no horizontal scroll
   - Fix any mobile issues found

Apply any CSS fixes to main.css. Prefer design tokens over hardcoded values. Follow cascade layer conventions (exhibit styles in pages layer).
  </action>
  <verify>
- Run local HTTP server and verify all 14 exhibits load without console errors
- Playwright screenshot sampling: at least 4 exhibits (a, g, j, m) at desktop (1200px), mobile (375px), light mode, dark mode = 16 screenshots minimum
- grep 'class="report-section"' exhibits/exhibit-*.html | wc -l (should be >= 70 total across all exhibits — each has 5+ sections)
- Verify no horizontal overflow at 375px viewport
  </verify>
  <done>
All 14 exhibits visually consistent: same section spacing, same component patterns, same typography. Dark mode verified with no contrast or readability issues. Mobile responsive at 375px with no overflow or layout breaks.

  <action>
Present the completed exhibit optimization work for human visual verification. All 14 exhibits have been restructured with impact-first headlines, consistent NTSB structure, restructured personnel tables, and visual consistency across light/dark modes and mobile viewports.

Verification steps for the user:
1. Open http://localhost:8080/testimonials.html — verify all 14 exhibit cards display with updated headlines
2. Click through to at least 3 exhibits (a, g, m recommended) — verify consistent section heading format
3. Toggle dark mode on an exhibit page — verify readability, contrast, visual quality
4. Resize browser to mobile width (~375px) — verify responsive layout, no horizontal scroll
5. Check a personnel section — verify it uses card/narrative format, not a blended table
6. Check a findings section — verify the investigation data table is preserved
