<objective>
Resolve all documentation conflicts and tracking inconsistencies accumulated during v1.2 milestone execution, ensuring ROADMAP.md, 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT.md, 15-VERIFICATION.md, v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md, and STATE.md accurately reflect the final delivered state.

Purpose: Clean milestone closure requires internally consistent documentation. The 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT and 15-02-SUMMARY contain inverted light/dark mode claims. The ROADMAP progress table has formatting drift (missing milestone column, missing dates). Five plan checkboxes remain unchecked despite completion. These inconsistencies would confuse future readers and block clean archival.

Output: All documentation files updated to reflect post-Phase-17 ground truth (270/270 accessibility tests pass, 20/20 requirements complete, 5/5 phases verified).

The 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT.md (written during Plan 15-03) and 15-02-SUMMARY.md contain inverted claims about light/dark mode compliance. After Phase 17, all issues are resolved (270/270 tests pass). Update both documents to reflect final state.

**15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT.md changes:**

1. Executive Summary "Compliance Status" section:
   - Change "Light Mode: 8/21 pages fully compliant (38%)" to "Light Mode: 21/21 pages fully compliant (100%)"
   - Change "Dark Mode: 21/21 pages fully compliant (100%)" to "Dark Mode: 21/21 pages fully compliant (100%)" (this was correct)
   - Change "Total Violations: 96 color-contrast issues in light mode across 13 pages" to "Total Violations: 0 (all resolved — see Phase 15-02, 15-03, and Phase 17 fixes)"
   - Change "Overall Status: Substantially Compliant with Minor Exceptions" to "Overall Status: Fully Compliant"

2. Per-Page Results "Summary Table":
   - All pages with "Minor Issues" status should be updated to "Pass" with 0 light violations
   - Total line: change to "0 total violation nodes in light mode, 0 violations in dark mode"

3. WCAG Checklist 1.4.3 entry:
   - Change status from "Partial" to "Pass"
   - Update notes to "All content passes; badge contrast issues resolved in Phase 15-02 and Phase 17"

4. Overall Compliance:
   - Change "Level AA: 96% compliant (27/28 applicable criteria)" to "Level AA: 100% compliant (28/28 applicable criteria)"
   - Remove or update the "Outstanding" line about badge elements

5. Cross-Browser Results section:
   - Update both Chromium and Firefox entries to show 135/135 tests passing (270/270 total)
   - Light mode: 21/21 passing (all pages), Dark mode: 21/21 passing (all pages)

6. Recommendations section:
   - Mark "Badge Contrast Remediation" as completed (done in Phase 15-02 + Phase 17)
   - Mark "Create Public Accessibility Statement" as completed (done in Phase 15-03)
   - Add a note at the top: "**Update (2026-02-22):** All immediate actions completed. Badge contrast resolved in Phase 15-02 (light mode) and Phase 17 (dark mode). Accessibility statement page created in Phase 15-03."

7. Conclusion "Remaining Work" section:
   - Update to reflect all work complete: "All identified issues have been resolved. Badge contrast fixed across all pages in both themes. Public accessibility statement live at /accessibility.html."

8. Add an update note at the top of the report (after the frontmatter area):
   "**Last Updated:** 2026-02-22 — Report reconciled to reflect post-Phase 17 final state. All 270/270 accessibility tests pass. All badge contrast issues resolved."

**15-VERIFICATION.md changes:**

1. Update frontmatter:
   - Change `status: human_needed` to `status: passed`
   - Change `score: 17/20 must-haves verified` to `score: 20/20 must-haves verified`
   - Remove or update `human_verification` entries — the test discrepancy is resolved

2. Observable Truths table:
   - Truth 4 ("Automated accessibility test suite runs and passes"): Change from "? UNCERTAIN" to "VERIFIED" with evidence "270/270 tests pass after Phase 17 (135/135 per browser)"
   - Truth 6 ("axe-core WCAG AA audit reports zero violations in light mode"): Change from "? UNCERTAIN" to "VERIFIED" with evidence "All light mode pages pass. Conflicting documentation resolved — 15-02-SUMMARY was correct (light mode 100%); 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT had inverted light/dark data, now corrected."
   - Truth 7 ("All text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios in both themes"): Change from "FAILED" to "VERIFIED" with evidence "Phase 17 resolved all dark mode badge contrast (270/270 tests pass). Light mode was already 100%."
   - Truth 20 ("Dark mode color system enhanced for WCAG compliance"): Change from "PARTIAL" to "VERIFIED" with evidence "Phase 17 brought dark mode to 100% WCAG AA compliance."

3. Requirements Coverage:
   - A11Y-02: Change from "UNCERTAIN" to "SATISFIED" with evidence "270/270 tests pass after Phase 17. Both light and dark mode fully WCAG AA compliant."

4. Update the Score line to "20/20 truths verified"

5. Update Gaps Summary to reflect no remaining gaps.

6. Remove or update the "Human Verification Required" section item 1 about resolving test results discrepancy — state it has been resolved.

**ROADMAP.md changes:**

1. **Check off completed plan boxes** — change `[ ]` to `[x]` for these plans:
   - Phase 14: `14-03-PLAN.md` (gap closure, completed)
   - Phase 15: `15-01-PLAN.md`, `15-02-PLAN.md`, `15-03-PLAN.md` (all three completed)
   - Phase 16: `16-04-PLAN.md` (gap closure, completed)

2. **Add completion dates for Phases 14, 15, 16** in the Phase sections:
   - Phase 14: Add `**Completed:** 2026-02-21` after the Scope section
   - Phase 15: Add `**Completed:** 2026-02-22` after the Scope section (Phase 15-03 ran on 2026-02-21, but dark mode was resolved 2026-02-22 via Phase 17)
   - Phase 16: Add `**Completed:** 2026-02-22` after the Scope section

3. **Fix progress table formatting** — Phases 13-17 have misaligned columns. The correct column order is: Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed. Fix these rows:
   - Row 13: `| 13. Exhibit Content Optimization | v1.2 | 3/3 | ✓ Complete | 2026-02-21 |`
   - Row 14: `| 14. Navigation & Footer Consistency | v1.2 | 3/3 | ✓ Complete | 2026-02-21 |`

   - Row 17: `| 17. Dark Mode WCAG AA Badge Contrast Fix | v1.2 | 1/1 | ✓ Complete | 2026-02-22 |`
   - Row 18: `| 18. Milestone Documentation Reconciliation | v1.2 | 1/1 | ✓ Complete | 2026-02-22 |`

4. **Update milestone status** — Change the v1.2 header line from "In Progress" to "Complete":
   - Change `### 📋 v1.2 Rustici-Targeted Content + Quality (In Progress)` to a completed marker
   - Update the Milestones section line from `📋` to `✅` and add completion date
   - Add Phase 18 section with completion marker

5. **Update Phase 18 section** — Add plan list and mark complete:
   - Add `**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete`
   - Add plan list: `- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — Documentation reconciliation and ROADMAP tracking fixes`
   - Add `**Completed:** 2026-02-22`

**v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md changes:**

1. Update frontmatter:
   - Change `status: tech_debt` to `status: complete`
   - Change `scores.requirements: 19/20` to `20/20`
   - Change `scores.phases: 4/5` to `5/5` (or 6/6 including Phase 17, depending on how phases are counted — use 5/5 for the original 5 content phases 12-16, noting Phase 17 as gap closure)
   - In `gaps.requirements`, update A11Y-02 entry:
     - Change `status: "partial"` to `status: "complete"`
     - Update evidence to note Phase 17 resolution: "All 270/270 accessibility tests pass. Light and dark mode fully WCAG AA compliant after Phase 17 fix."
   - In tech_debt.phase-15 items, remove or mark resolved:
     - "14 dark mode pages fail WCAG AA" → resolved by Phase 17
     - "Conflicting test result documentation" → resolved by Phase 18 Task 1
     - "Human verification pending" → resolved (270/270 tests pass)
   - In tech_debt.phase-ROADMAP items, remove or mark resolved — all addressed by this task

2. Update Executive Summary to reflect full completion.

3. Update Phase Verification Summary table:
   - Phase 15 status: Change from `human_needed` to `passed`, score `20/20`

4. Update Requirements Coverage Source 1 table:
   - A11Y-02: Change from `UNCERTAIN` to `PASS`

**STATE.md changes:**

1. Update Current Position to reflect Phase 18 complete
2. Update progress bar to show 18/18 phases complete
3. Update Session Continuity section
4. Update v1.2 milestone footer to show all phases complete including 17 and 18
