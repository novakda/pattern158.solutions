<objective>
Archive debug/audit scripts, clean up backup files, and create .gitignore for tool artifacts.

Purpose: Per CONTEXT.md, debug scripts should be archived to `.archive/` (not deleted), `.bak` files should be archived, and `.gitignore` should exclude tool artifacts. Also performs quick cross-reference and framing verification (CONTENT-11, CONTENT-12) as part of cleanup audit.

Output: .archive/ directory with archived files, .gitignore, clean project root

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Archive debug scripts and backup files to .archive/</name>
  <files>.archive/</files>
  <action>
Create `.archive/` directory and move (not delete) the following files into it:

1. **Debug/audit scripts from project root:** Identify any remaining .mjs debug scripts that are NOT part of the Playwright test infrastructure. The playwright.config.mjs is a legitimate config file and should stay. Scripts in tests/ that are part of the accessibility test suite (accessibility.spec.mjs, capture-evidence.mjs) should stay. Move only debug/screenshot/audit one-off scripts.

   Known candidates from git status and filesystem:
   - `tests/screenshot-key-fact-issue.mjs` -- debug screenshot script, not part of test suite
   - Any other one-off audit scripts found during scan

2. **Backup files:**
   - `css/main.css.bak` -- archive it

3. **Phase 15 screenshot artifacts for key-fact issue:**
   - `.planning/phases/15-comprehensive-accessibility-qa/screenshots/key-fact-issue/` -- per Claude's discretion, these are debug artifacts from a specific issue investigation; archive them

4. **Lighthouse temp directories:**
   - The Windows-path lighthouse directories (`C:\Users\...`) visible in git status are untracked temp artifacts. These should be .gitignored (they are on the Windows filesystem, not in the project tree -- just ensure .gitignore covers the pattern if they appear)

5. **Archive folder organization:** Per Claude's discretion -- use flat organization if file count is small (<10 files), otherwise organize by phase/category.

6. **Quick verification of CONTENT-11 and CONTENT-12:**
   - CONTENT-11: Verify cross-references exist in philosophy.html (links to exhibits E and M) and sitemap.xml (entries for exhibit-e, exhibit-m, exhibit-n). Log findings.
   - CONTENT-12: Run `grep -ri "budget substitute\|budget alternative\|cheap alternative" *.html exhibits/*.html` and confirm 0 results.

Do NOT delete any files. Archive only. Ensure .archive/ is committed to git (tracked, not ignored).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `.archive/` directory exists and contains archived files
    - `css/main.css.bak` no longer in its original location
    - `git status` shows .archive/ as new tracked directory
    - No debug scripts remain in project root (only playwright.config.mjs and package files)
    - `grep -ri "budget substitute\|budget alternative\|cheap alternative" *.html exhibits/*.html` returns 0 results
    - `grep "exhibit-e\|exhibit-m\|exhibit-n" sitemap.xml` returns entries for all 3
    - `grep "exhibit-e\|exhibit-m" philosophy.html` returns cross-reference links
  </verify>
  <done>All debug scripts and backup files archived to .archive/, CONTENT-11 cross-references verified, CONTENT-12 framing verified clean</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create .gitignore for tool artifacts</name>
  <files>.gitignore</files>
  <action>
Create a `.gitignore` file at project root to exclude tool artifacts that should not be committed. Based on the project's tech stack (Playwright, axe-core, Lighthouse) and git status showing untracked artifacts:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Test artifacts
test-results/
playwright-report/

# Lighthouse temp directories
lighthouse.*/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor files
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

Notes:
- Do NOT ignore `.archive/` (it must be tracked per CONTEXT.md decision)
- Do NOT ignore `.planning/` (planning artifacts are tracked)
- Do NOT ignore `playwright.config.mjs` (legitimate config)
- Do NOT ignore `tests/` directory (accessibility test suite is production infrastructure)
- The lighthouse temp directories use a glob pattern to catch the numbered variants

Verify the .gitignore works by checking `git status` before and after -- previously untracked tool artifacts should no longer appear.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `.gitignore` file exists at project root
    - `git status` no longer shows node_modules/, test-results/, playwright-report/ as untracked
    - `git status` no longer shows lighthouse temp directories
    - `.archive/` directory still appears in git status (not ignored)
    - `.planning/` directory still tracked (not ignored)
  </verify>
  <done>.gitignore created excluding tool artifacts, .archive/ and .planning/ remain tracked, git status clean of noise</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- .archive/ directory exists with archived scripts and .bak files
- .gitignore excludes node_modules, test-results, playwright-report, lighthouse dirs
- Project root clean of debug artifacts
- CONTENT-11 cross-references verified present
- CONTENT-12 no budget substitute language confirmed
- git status shows clean working tree (only expected changes)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- .archive/ committed to git with all archived files
- .gitignore properly excludes tool artifacts
- Project root contains only production files and legitimate configs
- CONTENT-11 and CONTENT-12 quick-verified
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-phase12-remediation-verification/16-02-SUMMARY.md`
