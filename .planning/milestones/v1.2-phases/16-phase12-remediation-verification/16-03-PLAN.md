<objective>
Comprehensive E2E verification of all Phase 12 content with full QA matrix and retroactive verification documentation.

Purpose: Per CONTEXT.md, the E2E verification must be a "full QA pass (links work + content present + styling correct + accessibility checks)" with "both light and dark mode for all 14 exhibits." The VERIFICATION.md must include "a full matrix: all 14 exhibits x QA dimensions (links, content, styling, accessibility, dark mode) with pass/fail per cell." This brings Phase 12 content to the same quality standard as newer phases and formally closes all 8 CONTENT requirements.

Output: Phase 12 VERIFICATION.md with full QA matrix, updated REQUIREMENTS.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Full E2E QA pass across all 14 exhibits with verification matrix</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/12-rustici-content/12-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Perform a comprehensive E2E quality assurance pass on all Phase 12 delivered content. Use Playwright (already configured in project) for automated verification where possible, and grep/file-based checks for content and structure validation.

**E2E Flow Verification:**

1. **Flow 1: Homepage -> Field Reports -> All 14 Exhibits**
   - Verify index.html links to testimonials.html (nav + hero CTAs)
   - Verify testimonials.html has 14 exhibit-card elements
   - Verify each card links to the correct exhibit file
   - Verify all 14 exhibit HTML files exist and are non-empty

2. **Flow 2: Homepage -> Portfolio -> All 14 Exhibits**
   - Verify index.html links to portfolio.html (nav + hero CTA)
   - Verify portfolio.html references all 14 exhibits in Featured Engagements
   - Verify Three Lenses section references E, M, N in Learning Systems narrative

**QA Dimensions for each of 14 exhibits (A through N):**

For each exhibit, verify and record pass/fail for:
- **Links:** Card link on testimonials.html resolves to existing file; internal links within exhibit page work
- **Content:** Page has substantive content (not a stub), has proper meta title/description, has section headings
- **Styling:** Uses proper CSS classes (report-section, section-heading, key-fact where applicable), no inline styles with hardcoded colors
- **Accessibility:** Has proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3), images have alt text, tables have headers, proper landmark structure
- **Dark mode:** No hardcoded colors that would break in dark mode, all color tokens properly referenced

**Verification Matrix Format:**

Create a markdown table in VERIFICATION.md with this structure:

```
| Exhibit | Links | Content | Styling | Accessibility | Dark Mode | Status |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| A - Electric Boat | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| B - Leadership Recognition | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
...for all 14...
```

**Requirement-specific evidence sections (CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12):**

For each of the 8 CONTENT requirements, document:
- What was required
- Codebase evidence (grep results, file locations, line numbers)
- Verification status (PASS/FAIL)

**Quality standard check:** Verify Phase 12 exhibits (E, M, N) match the quality of Phase 13-optimized exhibits:
- Section heading markup uses section-heading div pattern
- Impact-first headlines
- Proper NTSB investigation structure
- If any quality gaps found, document them for fixing (per CONTEXT.md: "fix quick wins, document larger issues")

Write the complete VERIFICATION.md with all sections above.

  <action>
Update project tracking documents to reflect Phase 16 completion:

1. **REQUIREMENTS.md updates:**
   - Ensure all 8 CONTENT requirements (CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12) are marked `[x]` complete
   - Update traceability table to show Phase 12 + Phase 16 (verification) for each
   - Update "Last updated" timestamp
   - Verify coverage count is accurate

2. **STATE.md updates:**
   - Update Current Position to reflect Phase 16 complete
   - Update Last activity with plan 03 completion
   - Add any new decisions from this phase execution
   - Update v1.2 Velocity metrics
   - Update Session Continuity section
   - Mark v1.2 Milestone status

3. **Log decisions made during this phase:**
   - Card redesign approach (improved hierarchy, retrofit all 14)
   - Archive approach (.archive/ folder, not deletion)
   - .gitignore creation for tool artifacts
   - Verification matrix format used

  <verify>
    - `grep -c '\[x\].*CONTENT' .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` returns 8

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of exhibit cards and dark mode</name>
  <files>testimonials.html</files>
  <action>
Human verifies the visual quality of the redesigned exhibit cards and dark mode rendering.

What was built: All 14 exhibit cards on testimonials.html redesigned with improved visual hierarchy. Cards for Exhibits E, M, N added. Full E2E QA pass completed with verification matrix. Project cleaned up with .archive/ and .gitignore.

How to verify:
1. Open testimonials.html in browser (serve with `npx http-server -p 8080`)
2. Verify all 14 exhibit cards are visible with consistent improved design
3. Verify visual hierarchy is clean: label, client, date, title, context/quote, tags, link
4. Toggle dark mode -- verify all card elements render correctly
5. Check mobile view (375px) -- verify cards are responsive
6. Click through to exhibits E, M, N -- verify links work
7. Verify exhibit E is between D and F, M is after L, N is after M
8. Review the VERIFICATION.md matrix at `.planning/phases/12-rustici-content/12-VERIFICATION.md`

Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe issues to fix.
