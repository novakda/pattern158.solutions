<objective>
Write the LinkedIn headline and about section as copy-paste-ready deliverables optimized for recruiter search discovery and human readability.

Purpose: These two sections are the foundation of LinkedIn profile optimization — the headline controls recruiter search visibility (60 chars visible on mobile, 220 max) and the about section converts profile views into recruiter outreach (first 300 chars visible before "see more"). Together they establish Dan's engineering-first identity.

Output: Two deliverable markdown files with copy-paste-ready content, character counts, mobile truncation analysis, and keyword density notes.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write LinkedIn Headline</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/23-foundation-search-optimization/deliverables/headline.md</files>
  <action>
Create the headline.md deliverable with a copy-paste-ready LinkedIn headline optimized for recruiter search.

**Character constraints:**
- Maximum: 220 characters (from training data — flag for UI verification)
- Mobile-visible portion: ~60 characters (first tier keywords HERE)
- Ensure mobile-visible portion makes sense as standalone phrase (no mid-sentence truncation)

**Locked decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Lead with "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" in the visible ~60 characters
- No eLearning/SCORM keywords in headline — pure engineering
- No employment status — use LinkedIn's "Open to Work" badge separately

**Claude's discretion decisions (make and document):**
- Vue.js vs React ordering: Research notes React has ~3:1 job market advantage. If both fit in 60 chars after "Senior Full-Stack Engineer," put Vue.js first (authentic to user's strength). If space-constrained for visible portion, lean React for broader reach. Document the choice and reasoning.
- Brand mention: Whether to include "pattern158.solutions" in the extended portion
- Years of experience: Whether to include "25+ years" or similar
- Extended portion keyword mix: Fill remaining ~160 chars with searchable keywords (TypeScript, Node.js, AI/LLM Integration, System Architecture, WCAG, SQL, REST APIs, CI/CD) — prioritize exact-match recruiter search terms
- Tone: Technical authority positioning, not narrative hook (headline is for search, not storytelling)

**Deliverable format:**
```
# LinkedIn Headline

## Copy-Paste Ready

[The headline text]

## Analysis

- Total characters: N/220
- Mobile-visible (~60 chars): "[first 60 chars]"
- Mobile standalone check: [Does it make sense cut off here? Yes/No]
- Primary keywords (visible): [list]
- Secondary keywords (extended): [list]
- Keywords NOT included (intentional): [list with reasoning]

## Discretion Decisions

[Document each Claude's Discretion choice with reasoning]

## Verification Notes

- [ ] User: Verify headline character limit is still 220 in LinkedIn UI
- [ ] User: Test mobile truncation point on LinkedIn mobile app
- [ ] User: Confirm no mid-phrase truncation on mobile
```

**Anti-patterns to AVOID:**
- Keyword stuffing: "Vue React TypeScript Node SQL" with no structure
- Generic filler: "Passionate about technology" or "Let's connect!"
- Employment status: "Open to opportunities" or "Available for hire"
- Title inflation: "Principal" or "Staff" (Dan's formal title is Senior)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Character count of headline is within 220 characters
2. First 60 characters contain "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" and at least one framework keyword
3. No eLearning/SCORM keywords present in headline
4. No buzzwords (passionate, innovative, results-driven) present
5. Mobile-visible portion reads as complete phrase (no truncation mid-word or mid-phrase)
6. deliverables/headline.md exists with all required sections

  <done>headline.md contains copy-paste-ready headline within 220 chars, mobile-visible portion leads with "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" and framework keywords, no eLearning keywords, all discretion decisions documented</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write LinkedIn About Section</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/23-foundation-search-optimization/deliverables/about.md</files>
  <action>
Create the about.md deliverable with a copy-paste-ready LinkedIn About/Summary section.

**Character constraints:**
- Maximum: 2600 characters (verified from LinkedIn official blog)
- "See more" fold: ~300 characters visible before truncation on mobile (training data estimate — flag for verification)
- Hook must work standalone in first 300 chars

**Locked narrative arc (from CONTEXT.md):**
1. **Differentiator hook** (first 300 chars): Establish what makes Dan different. NOT the NTSB/forensic story as opening hook. Engineering identity with something memorable.
2. **Engineering identity and stack breadth**: Modern 2024-2026 work leads (MCAPS AILT, ContentAIQ). Core stack woven naturally: Vue.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js. System architecture demonstrated through experience.
3. **Key proof points**: GM Investigation as ONE of several highlights (not centerpiece). NTSB/forensic angle as methodology descriptor: "I bring forensic rigor to every system I build." Other proof points from 28 years of work.
4. **Forward-looking (transition as opportunity)**: Building pattern158.solutions. Ready for modern engineering work. Address single-employer perception: "equivalent of 5+ distinct engineering roles."
5. **Contact CTA**: Close with specific "looking for" statement (modern web platforms, product-focused teams, remote or hybrid, mid-to-large companies). End: "Let's talk: dan@pattern158.solutions"

**Locked constraints:**
- First person, narrative tone — storytelling that weaves career arc
- Technologies woven into narrative naturally, no separate tech stack list
- GP Strategies tenure reframed as variety — "equivalent of 5+ distinct engineering roles," NOT a rename to Cornerstone
- 2024-2026 work (MCAPS AILT, ContentAIQ) leads — most recent = most relevant
- GM investigation as one of several highlights, not the centerpiece
- Single-employer perception addressed directly
- dan@pattern158.solutions at end as contact CTA
- AVOID: "passionate" cliches, soft skill listings, generic buzzwords

**Core identity traits that must come through (from CONTEXT.md):**
- Toolmaker: builds tools and automation
- Trench-tested: works in same environments as users
- Quality over speed: cares about craft
- Evidence-based: documents, traces, proves — NTSB methodology
- Cross-functional: understands business context
- Self-directed: effective autonomously
- Rising tide: builds leverage, not just features

**Claude's discretion decisions (make and document):**
- Exact hook content (first 300 chars)
- Formatting: unicode bullets vs prose paragraphs (research suggests short paragraphs work best on LinkedIn)
- WCAG mention placement
- pattern158.solutions reference level
- Tone calibration for LinkedIn audience
- Proof point selection (which projects to name)
- Location mention (or not)
- Layoff candor level (builder-in-transition vs available-and-ready)
- Vue vs React ordering within narrative

**Source content for authentic voice and claims:**
- Read index.html for Dan's hero text, Five Core Influences, and how the site frames his work
- Read philosophy.html for brand elements (especially "Build the Tool" and "Provider of Clarity")
- Read portfolio.html for Three Lenses positioning and exhibit summaries
- Read testimonials.html for specific project metrics and outcomes

**Deliverable format:**
```
# LinkedIn About Section

## Copy-Paste Ready

[The about section text — exactly as it should appear in LinkedIn]

## Analysis

- Total characters: N/2600
- Visible before fold (~300 chars): "[first 300 chars]"
- Fold check: [Does the visible portion hook the reader? Does it end at a natural break?]
- Keywords included: [list with approximate position]
- Keyword density: [each primary keyword and count]
- Identity traits conveyed: [which of the 7 traits and where]

## Discretion Decisions

[Document each Claude's Discretion choice with reasoning]

## Verification Notes

- [ ] User: Verify about section character limit is still 2600 in LinkedIn UI
- [ ] User: Test "see more" fold position on LinkedIn mobile app
- [ ] User: Confirm formatting (line breaks, bullets) renders correctly in LinkedIn
- [ ] User: Verify dan@pattern158.solutions displays as text (LinkedIn may strip mailto: links)
```

**Anti-patterns to AVOID:**
- Third-person voice: "Dan Novak is a software engineer..."
- Keyword stuffing: listing technologies without narrative context
- Buzzword bingo: passionate, innovative, results-driven, team player, self-starter, strategic, synergy, leverage
- Generic opener: "With 28 years of experience in the technology industry..."
- Separate tech stack section: "Technologies: React, Vue, TypeScript..." as a standalone list
- Cornerstone confusion: GP Strategies was the employer, Cornerstone OnDemand is an LMS product clients used
- Claiming pattern158.solutions uses modern frameworks (it's static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS currently)
