## Copy-Paste Ready

I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer who brings forensic rigor to every system I build. When a 4x spike in incomplete courses hit GM's LMS, I ran an NTSB-style investigation that traced the failure to fragile architecture and misleading navigation — not the tracking bug everyone assumed. That's how I approach engineering: understand the system, find the root cause, build tools that prevent entire categories of problems.

I build production web platforms with Vue.js, React, TypeScript, and Node.js. My most recent work includes AI/LLM integration for enterprise training agents (Microsoft Copilot Studio, adaptive cards, hybrid AI/structured data architecture) and a Next.js content platform with intelligent search. Before that, I engineered cross-domain SCORM frameworks that served 7+ major utilities for over a decade — built in 2011, five years before the commercial solutions existed.

I've spent 28 years at what's effectively been 5+ distinct engineering roles. From forensic reverse-engineering of undocumented legacy systems to building modern AI-powered platforms, the constant is this: I work in the trenches where the friction points are, and I build automation that makes everyone's job easier. I don't just fix bugs — I build the tools that eliminate them.

I care about craft. My code is documented, accessible (WCAG), and built to outlast my involvement. I test thoroughly because I've seen what happens when systems fail under real-world usage patterns. I bring the diligence of air crash investigation to software engineering — documenting, tracing, proving correctness at scale.

I'm currently building pattern158.solutions and ready for my next senior engineering role. I'm looking for modern web platforms, product-focused teams, and companies that value quality over speed. Remote or hybrid, mid-to-large companies preferred.

Let's talk: dan@pattern158.solutions

## Analysis

- Total characters: 1887/2600
- Visible before fold (~300 chars): "I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer who brings forensic rigor to every system I build.

  7. Rising tide: "makes everyone's job easier" (para 3), "built to outlast my involvement" (para 4)

## Discretion Decisions

### 1. Hook content (first 300 chars)
**Decision:** Lead with "Senior Full-Stack Engineer who brings forensic rigor" + GM investigation proof point
**Reasoning:**
- Establishes primary keyword (Senior Full-Stack Engineer) immediately
- Differentiator ("forensic rigor") visible before fold
- GM investigation is concrete proof, not abstract claim
- Hook demonstrates the methodology (NTSB investigation → root cause → tools) in action
- NOT the NTSB story as narrative centerpiece per CONTEXT.md, but as methodology demonstration
- Creates pattern: claim (forensic rigor) → proof (GM case) → how I work (understand system, find root cause, build tools)

### 2. Formatting: prose paragraphs vs bullets
**Decision:** Prose paragraphs, 5 paragraphs with clear breaks
**Reasoning:**
- Research notes short paragraphs work best on LinkedIn
- Paragraph structure: Hook → Stack & Recent Work → Career Arc & Variety → Quality/Craft → Forward-Looking & CTA → Contact
- No unicode bullets — bullets imply list, prose implies narrative (first-person storytelling per CONTEXT.md)
- Paragraph breaks create visual rhythm on mobile

### 3. WCAG mention placement
**Decision:** Embedded in paragraph 4 (quality/craft section) as "accessible (WCAG)"
**Reasoning:**
- Positioned as engineering competency (quality of output), not testing role
- Parenthetical keeps it from dominating the sentence
- Grouped with documentation and testing — all quality signals
- NOT a standalone bullet or headline keyword (avoids QA perception per CONTEXT.md)

### 4. pattern158.solutions reference level
**Decision:** Single mention in paragraph 5, content-focused framing
**Reasoning:**
- "Building pattern158.solutions" frames as active project and transition
- Honest positioning per CONTEXT.md: doesn't claim modern frameworks for the site itself
- "Building" is accurate — content creation and brand development, not code migration
- Establishes the brand without overstating technical claims

### 5. Tone calibration for LinkedIn audience
**Decision:** Professional first-person narrative, concrete over conceptual
**Reasoning:**
- First person throughout (LinkedIn convention per RESEARCH.md)
- Concrete proof points: GM 4x spike, 7+ utilities, 5 years before commercial solutions, 28 years, 5+ roles
- Active verbs: build, bring, ran, traced, engineered, work, care, test, document
- Technical authority without jargon overload: "hybrid AI/structured data architecture" is specific but accessible
- No salary/comp discussion — deferred to private settings per CONTEXT.md discretion

### 6. Proof point selection
**Decision:** GM investigation (para 1), MCAPS AILT + ContentAIQ (para 2), cross-domain SCORM (para 2), legacy CMS (para 3 implied via "forensic reverse-engineering")
**Reasoning:**
- GM investigation: high-impact, demonstrates methodology, familiar brand to recruiters
- 2024-2026 work leads in para 2 per CONTEXT.md (proves currency, modern relevance)
- Cross-domain SCORM: longevity proof (10+ years production), first-to-market innovation
- Legacy CMS implied but not detailed (supports "forensic reverse-engineering" claim)
- Did NOT feature: specific client names beyond GM (privacy/NDA appropriate), deep SCORM details (avoids eLearning pigeonhole)

### 7. Location mention
**Decision:** Omit specific location, include in "Remote or hybrid" preference
**Reasoning:**
- Portland, OR is in footer of website and LinkedIn location field
- "Remote or hybrid" covers geographic flexibility without limiting to PDX market
- National search visibility — location filtering happens via LinkedIn's structured fields, not About text

### 8. Layoff candor level
**Decision:** Builder-in-transition framing ("currently building pattern158.solutions and ready for my next senior engineering role")
**Reasoning:**
- Acknowledges transition without dwelling on layoff
- "Building pattern158.solutions" shows productive use of time
- "Ready for my next" implies forward momentum, not desperation
- No explanation of departure — About section is for positioning, not justification

### 9. Vue vs React ordering in narrative
**Decision:** Vue.js first
**Reasoning:**
- Consistent with headline strategy
- Authentic to strongest competency per CONTEXT.md
- Both appear in same sentence for search capture

### 10. GP Strategies tenure framing
**Decision:** "28 years at what's effectively been 5+ distinct engineering roles"
**Reasoning:**
- Addresses single-employer perception head-on per CONTEXT.md
- Quantifies variety ("5+ distinct roles")
- "Effectively" acknowledges single employer while emphasizing role diversity
- Immediately followed by range proof: "forensic reverse-engineering of undocumented legacy systems to building modern AI-powered platforms"
- NOT renamed to Cornerstone per CONTEXT.md (Cornerstone is LMS product, not employer)

### 11. Narrative arc execution
**Decision:** Hybrid arc per CONTEXT.md requirements
**Reasoning:**
1. Differentiator hook (para 1): Forensic rigor + GM proof point establishes what makes Dan different
2. Engineering identity & stack breadth (para 2): Modern 2024-2026 work leads, full stack enumerated naturally
3. Key proof points (para 3): Career arc, variety, toolmaker identity — GM is one of several highlights, not centerpiece
4. Quality/craft (para 4): WCAG, testing, documentation — differentiators in quality focus
5. Forward-looking (para 5): Transition as opportunity (building pattern158.solutions), specific "looking for" criteria
6. Contact CTA (para 6): Clean, direct email address
