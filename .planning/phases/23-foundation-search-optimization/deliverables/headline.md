# LinkedIn Headline

## Copy-Paste Ready

Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Vue.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js | AI/LLM Integration | System Architecture | Building forensic-quality web platforms

## Analysis

- Total characters: 158/220
- Mobile-visible (~60 chars): "Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Vue.js, React, TypeScript"
- Mobile standalone check: Yes — reads as complete professional identity with primary frameworks visible
- Primary keywords (visible): Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Vue.js, React, TypeScript
- Secondary keywords (extended): Node.js, AI/LLM Integration, System Architecture, forensic-quality, web platforms
- Keywords NOT included (intentional):
  - eLearning/SCORM — per CONTEXT.md, pure engineering positioning
  - WCAG/accessibility — engineering competency, not headline keyword (avoid QA perception)
  - SQL/NoSQL — omitted for space, covered in About section
  - CI/CD — omitted for space, standard expectation for senior role
  - Power Platform — last-resort territory per CONTEXT.md
  - Years of experience (28 years) — creates age bias, recent work matters more
  - pattern158.solutions — brand mention deferred to About section for cleaner headline
  - Employment status — using LinkedIn's "Open to Work" badge separately per CONTEXT.md

## Discretion Decisions

### 1. Vue.js vs React ordering
**Decision:** Vue.js first
**Reasoning:** Both fit in visible 60-char mobile portion. Vue.js is Dan's strongest frontend competency (more confident than React per CONTEXT.md). React immediately follows as strong secondary, capturing both keywords for search. Authentic positioning without sacrificing market reach — recruiter Boolean searches for either framework will match.

### 2. AI/LLM Integration inclusion
**Decision:** Include in extended portion
**Reasoning:** Production experience via MCAPS AILT and ContentAIQ (2024-2026). Emerging high-value keyword. Differentiator from pure frontend developers. Demonstrates currency and modern relevance.

### 3. "Building forensic-quality web platforms" phrase
**Decision:** Include as narrative anchor
**Reasoning:** Balances keyword density with human readability (dual-audience pattern from RESEARCH.md). "Forensic-quality" is Dan's differentiator (NTSB methodology). "Web platforms" clarifies domain (not mobile, not data engineering). Makes headline readable, not just keyword list.

### 4. System Architecture vs other architectural keywords
**Decision:** "System Architecture" without qualification
**Reasoning:** Demonstrated competency per CONTEXT.md (de facto, not formal title). Captures searches for senior-level design roles. No claim of "Principal" or "Staff" title (title inflation per PLAN anti-patterns).

### 5. Brand mention (pattern158.solutions)
**Decision:** Omit from headline
**Reasoning:** Cleaner keyword focus. Brand covered thoroughly in About section. Headline optimized for recruiter search, About optimized for conversion.

### 6. Years of experience
**Decision:** Omit
**Reasoning:** 28 years creates age bias risk. Recent work (2024-2026) demonstrates currency better than tenure. About section addresses single-employer perception and career arc.

### 7. Tone calibration
**Decision:** Technical authority with narrative element
**Reasoning:** "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" establishes seniority. Framework stack demonstrates breadth. "Forensic-quality" injects personality without buzzwords. Professional, not conversational — headline is for search, About is for storytelling.

## Verification Notes

- [ ] User: Verify headline character limit is still 220 in LinkedIn UI (training data spec, needs 2026 confirmation)
- [ ] User: Test mobile truncation point on LinkedIn mobile app (estimated ~60 chars, needs actual device verification)
- [ ] User: Confirm no mid-phrase truncation on mobile (should cut cleanly after "TypeScript")
- [ ] User: Verify "Open to Work" badge is enabled separately (headline omits employment status per strategy)
