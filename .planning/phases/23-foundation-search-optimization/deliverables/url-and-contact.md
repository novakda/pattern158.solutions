# Custom URL & Contact Email

## Custom URL Strategy

### Primary: pattern158

- **Full URL:** linkedin.com/in/pattern158
- **Rationale:** Brand-aligned with pattern158.solutions domain — establishes consistent identity across platforms. The "pattern158" brand represents Dan's engineering methodology (pattern recognition, systematic problem-solving, evidence-based approach). This URL creates immediate connection between LinkedIn profile and professional website, reinforcing brand recall for recruiters who visit both.
- **Cross-platform consistency:**
  - Domain: pattern158.solutions (exact match)
  - GitHub: username is novakda (different), but pattern158.solutions is prominently linked
  - Professional email: dan@pattern158.solutions (brand match)
  - Overall: Strong brand consistency — "pattern158" is the professional identity

### Fallback 1: dan-novak

- **Full URL:** linkedin.com/in/dan-novak
- **Rationale:** Name-based fallback provides human-recognizable identifier. Hyphenated format is conventional LinkedIn pattern (firstname-lastname). Optimizes for recruiters who search by name directly rather than keyword searches. More conservative choice if pattern158 is unavailable.

### Fallback 2: dannovak

- **Full URL:** linkedin.com/in/dannovak
- **Rationale:** No-hyphen variant of name fallback. Simpler to verbally communicate ("linkedin.com/in/dannovak" vs "linkedin.com/in/dan-hyphen-novak"). Covers case where dan-novak is taken but dannovak is available.

### LinkedIn URL Constraints

**Format requirements:**
- 3-100 characters allowed
- No spaces, symbols, or special characters (hyphens ARE allowed)
- Cannot contain the word "linkedin"
- Case insensitive (Pattern158 = pattern158 = PATTERN158)
- Letters, numbers, and hyphens only

**Modification limits:**
- Can change custom URL up to 5 times in 6 months
- Choose carefully — frequent changes may confuse existing contacts who have the old link

**Availability:**
- LinkedIn UI shows availability immediately when typing in the edit field
- If primary choice is unavailable, try fallbacks in order
- Claimed URLs are permanent until changed (don't squat on URLs you're not using)

## Contact Email Placement

### Email: dan@pattern158.solutions

### Placement 1: Contact Info Section (Authoritative Source)

**What to do in LinkedIn UI:**
1. Navigate to: Profile > Click "Contact info" button (below profile photo)
2. In the Contact Info dialog, click "Edit"
3. Add or update email field to: dan@pattern158.solutions
4. Set visibility: **"Anyone"** (recommended for recruiter discovery — recruiters outside your network need to see this)
5. Save changes
6. Verify: Click "Contact info" button again and confirm dan@pattern158.solutions appears

**Why this placement:**
- Contact Info section is LinkedIn's official/authoritative place for contact details
- Recruiters know to check here for email/phone
- Email visibility setting controls who can see it (set to "Anyone" for maximum discoverability)

**Visibility recommendation:**
- **"Anyone" (recommended):** Recruiters outside your network can see your email — critical for cold outreach from hiring managers
- "Your connections only:" Limits discoverability to existing network — less useful for job search
- Consider: If concerned about spam, use "Your connections" but know this reduces recruiter reach

### Placement 2: About Section Close (Visibility Without Clicking)

**Context:**
The About section already includes dan@pattern158.solutions in the closing CTA (delivered in Plan 01's about.md). This is the "visible without clicking" placement.

**Why dual placement:**
- Many recruiters skim the About section and never click "Contact info" button
- Including email in About text = zero-friction contact path for recruiters
- Contact Info section = authoritative/official, About section = visible/convenient
- Dual placement maximizes discoverability: lazy recruiters see it in About, diligent recruiters find it in Contact Info

**Note:** About section email is plain text, not a clickable mailto: link (LinkedIn strips those). Recruiters copy-paste the email into their email client.

## Verification Notes

After applying changes, verify:

- [ ] **User: Check if "pattern158" is available** — Open LinkedIn profile editor > Edit public profile & URL (right sidebar) > Click edit icon next to URL > Type "pattern158" and see if LinkedIn accepts it. If shows "Not available" or "Already taken," proceed to Fallback 1.

- [ ] **User: If "pattern158" unavailable, try fallbacks in order** — Try "dan-novak" next. If also unavailable, try "dannovak". Document which URL was successfully claimed.

- [ ] **User: Verify custom URL is live** — After saving, visit linkedin.com/in/[your-chosen-url] in browser and confirm it loads your profile.

- [ ] **User: Verify email displays correctly in Contact Info** — Click your "Contact info" button and confirm dan@pattern158.solutions appears. Check visibility setting is "Anyone" (or your chosen setting).

- [ ] **User: Verify email appears in About section** — View your profile (not in edit mode) and confirm dan@pattern158.solutions appears in the About text near the end (from Plan 01's about.md).

- [ ] **User: Test email discoverability as logged-out user** — Open browser in incognito/private mode, visit your LinkedIn profile URL, and verify whether email is visible to non-logged-in visitors (depends on your visibility settings).

## Cross-Platform Consistency Check

After claiming custom URL, verify consistency:

- **LinkedIn URL:** linkedin.com/in/pattern158 (or chosen fallback)
- **Website domain:** pattern158.solutions
- **Professional email:** dan@pattern158.solutions
- **GitHub:** profile links to pattern158.solutions (username novakda remains for legacy reasons)

**Brand alignment:** All platforms should point to pattern158.solutions as the professional hub. LinkedIn custom URL reinforces the pattern158 brand identity.
