# Phase 23: LinkedIn UI Application Instructions

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for applying all Phase 23 profile changes in the LinkedIn UI. Follow these steps in order — some changes (custom URL) have modification limits, so it's important to verify before applying.

**What you'll be updating:**
1. Custom URL (linkedin.com/in/pattern158 or fallback)
2. Contact email (dan@pattern158.solutions)
3. Headline (from deliverables/headline.md)
4. About section (from deliverables/about.md)

**Estimated time:** 15-20 minutes

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before making any changes, verify LinkedIn's current specifications and document your current content for rollback if needed.

### 1. Open LinkedIn Profile Editor

- [ ] Navigate to your LinkedIn profile (linkedin.com/in/[your-current-url])
- [ ] Ensure you're viewing your own profile (you should see "Edit" buttons)

### 2. Verify Character Limits

Research indicates these limits (as of 2026-02-22), but LinkedIn may have updated them. Verify before writing content:

- [ ] **Headline limit:** Click Edit on your intro section. Count the character limit shown in the editor. Research says 220 characters — confirm this is still accurate.
- [ ] **About limit:** Click Edit on your About section. Count the character limit shown in the editor. Research says 2600 characters — confirm this is still accurate.
- [ ] **If limits differ from research:** STOP and note the actual limits. The deliverables (headline.md, about.md) were written to 220/2600 specs. If LinkedIn has different limits, you may need to adjust content before pasting.

### 3. Backup Current Content

Create a rollback point in case you want to revert:

- [ ] **Current headline:** Copy your existing headline text and save to a local file or screenshot
- [ ] **Current about:** Copy your existing about section text and save to a local file or screenshot
- [ ] **Current URL:** Note your current custom URL (if any) — you can change it up to 5 times in 6 months

### 4. Review Deliverables

Ensure you have access to the content you'll be pasting:

- [ ] Open `deliverables/headline.md` and locate the "Copy-Paste Ready" section
- [ ] Open `deliverables/about.md` and locate the "Copy-Paste Ready" section
- [ ] Open `deliverables/url-and-contact.md` for URL fallback strategy reference

## Step 1: Claim Custom URL

**Do this first** — custom URL changes have a 5-per-6-month limit. If you claim the wrong URL, you waste a modification.

### 1.1 Navigate to URL Editor

- [ ] From your LinkedIn profile, look for the right sidebar section "Edit public profile & URL"
- [ ] Click "Edit public profile & URL" link
- [ ] You'll see your current public profile URL displayed

### 1.2 Attempt Primary URL: pattern158

- [ ] Click the edit icon (pencil) next to your current URL
- [ ] In the text field, type: **pattern158**
- [ ] LinkedIn will immediately show if this URL is available or already taken
- [ ] **If available:** Continue to step 1.4 (save)
- [ ] **If unavailable:** Continue to step 1.3 (try fallback)

### 1.3 Try Fallback URLs (if needed)

If "pattern158" is unavailable, try fallbacks in this order:

- [ ] **Fallback 1:** Type **dan-novak** and check availability
  - If available: Continue to step 1.4 (save)
  - If unavailable: Try Fallback 2

- [ ] **Fallback 2:** Type **dannovak** and check availability
  - If available: Continue to step 1.4 (save)
  - If unavailable: Choose your own fallback (consider: pattern158solutions, dannovak158, novakdan)

### 1.4 Save Custom URL

- [ ] Click "Save" button to claim the URL
- [ ] LinkedIn will confirm the change
- [ ] **Document which URL you claimed:** _________________ (you'll need this for verification)

### 1.5 Verify Custom URL Works

- [ ] Open a new browser tab
- [ ] Navigate to: **linkedin.com/in/[your-claimed-url]**
- [ ] Confirm it loads your LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Bookmark this URL for future reference

## Step 2: Update Contact Email

### 2.1 Open Contact Info Section

- [ ] Return to your LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Click the **"Contact info"** button (located below your profile photo and headline)
- [ ] A dialog/modal will appear with your contact information

### 2.2 Edit Email

- [ ] In the Contact Info dialog, click "Edit" (pencil icon) or directly click on the email field
- [ ] Add or update the email field to: **dan@pattern158.solutions**
- [ ] (Optional) Add this as a secondary email if you want to keep an existing primary email — the goal is for dan@pattern158.solutions to be visible

### 2.3 Set Email Visibility

**Recommended setting:** "Anyone" (for maximum recruiter discoverability)

- [ ] Locate the visibility dropdown for the email field
- [ ] Select: **"Anyone"** — This allows recruiters outside your network to see your email (critical for cold outreach)
- [ ] Alternative (less discoverable): "Your connections" — Only people you're connected to can see it (reduces spam but also reduces recruiter reach)

### 2.4 Save Contact Info

- [ ] Click "Save" button in the Contact Info dialog
- [ ] Close the dialog

### 2.5 Verify Email Displays

- [ ] Click "Contact info" button again
- [ ] Confirm **dan@pattern158.solutions** appears in the list
- [ ] Confirm visibility setting is "Anyone" (or your chosen setting)

## Step 3: Update Headline

### 3.1 Open Headline Editor

- [ ] On your LinkedIn profile, locate the "Intro" section (your name, headline, location)
- [ ] Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on the Intro section

### 3.2 Paste New Headline

- [ ] Open `deliverables/headline.md` and locate the **"Copy-Paste Ready"** section
- [ ] Copy the entire headline text (should be within 220 characters)
- [ ] Return to LinkedIn editor
- [ ] **Clear the existing headline field** completely (delete all current text)
- [ ] Paste the new headline from headline.md

### 3.3 Verify Character Count

- [ ] Check LinkedIn's character counter in the editor
- [ ] Confirm it shows you're within the 220-character limit (or whatever limit LinkedIn displays)
- [ ] **If over limit:** LinkedIn will show an error. Return to headline.md and trim content, then re-paste.
- [ ] **If truncated:** LinkedIn may silently truncate — verify the full text appears in the editor field

### 3.4 Preview Mobile Truncation

Before saving, mentally note the first ~60 characters:

- [ ] Read the first 60 characters of your new headline
- [ ] Verify it makes sense as a standalone phrase (no mid-sentence cut-off)
- [ ] Confirm "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" appears in those first 60 characters

### 3.5 Save Headline

- [ ] Click "Save" button in the Intro editor
- [ ] LinkedIn will update your profile

### 3.6 Verify Headline Displays

- [ ] View your profile (exit edit mode)
- [ ] Confirm the new headline appears correctly
- [ ] Check for any formatting issues (LinkedIn should display as plain text)

## Step 4: Update About Section

### 4.1 Open About Editor

- [ ] On your LinkedIn profile, locate the **About** section
- [ ] Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on the About section

### 4.2 Paste New About Text

- [ ] Open `deliverables/about.md` and locate the **"Copy-Paste Ready"** section
- [ ] Copy the entire about section text (should be within 2600 characters)
- [ ] Return to LinkedIn editor
- [ ] **Clear the existing about field** completely (delete all current text)
- [ ] Paste the new about text from about.md

### 4.3 Verify Character Count

- [ ] Check LinkedIn's character counter in the editor
- [ ] Confirm it shows you're within the 2600-character limit (or whatever limit LinkedIn displays)
- [ ] **If over limit:** Return to about.md and trim content, then re-paste

### 4.4 Verify Formatting

- [ ] Review the pasted text in the LinkedIn editor
- [ ] Confirm line breaks appear correctly (LinkedIn should preserve paragraph breaks)
- [ ] Check for any unicode characters or bullets — verify they render correctly
- [ ] Confirm **dan@pattern158.solutions** appears near the end of the text

### 4.5 Preview "See More" Fold

Before saving, check the first ~300 characters:

- [ ] Read the first 300 characters of your new about section
- [ ] Verify it works as a standalone hook (makes sense even if reader doesn't click "see more")
- [ ] Confirm it ends at a natural sentence or phrase break (not mid-sentence)

### 4.6 Save About Section

- [ ] Click "Save" button in the About editor
- [ ] LinkedIn will update your profile

### 4.7 Verify About Displays

- [ ] View your profile (exit edit mode)
- [ ] Confirm the new about text appears correctly
- [ ] Check where LinkedIn places the "see more" fold — does it align with your ~300 character estimate?
- [ ] Confirm formatting (paragraphs, line breaks) renders as expected

## Step 5: Configure Open to Work Settings (Recommended)

While not part of the core deliverables, this setting improves recruiter discovery:

### 5.1 Enable "Open to Work"

- [ ] On your LinkedIn profile, click **"Open to"** button (near your profile photo)
- [ ] Select **"Finding a new job"**
- [ ] Fill out your job preferences:
  - Job titles: Senior Software Engineer, Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Senior Frontend Engineer, Senior Backend Engineer
  - Location types: Remote, Hybrid
  - Location: (your preferred locations)
  - Start date: Immediately
  - Employment type: Full-time

### 5.2 Set Visibility to Recruiter-Only

**Recommended:** Do NOT use the public "Open to Work" green banner (can signal desperation)

- [ ] In the "Open to Work" settings, locate visibility options
- [ ] Select: **"Recruiters only"** — This shows your availability to recruiters using LinkedIn Recruiter, but doesn't add a visible green banner to your profile photo
- [ ] **Avoid:** "All LinkedIn members" (adds green #OpenToWork banner — can appear desperate)

### 5.3 Save Open to Work Settings

- [ ] Click "Save" to apply Open to Work settings
- [ ] Verify your profile photo does NOT have a green #OpenToWork frame (recruiter-only mode)

## Post-Flight Verification

After all changes are applied, verify everything works correctly across devices and visibility modes.

### 1. Desktop Public View

- [ ] Open your LinkedIn profile in normal mode (logged in)
- [ ] Verify headline displays correctly (no truncation, no formatting issues)
- [ ] Verify about section displays with correct "see more" fold
- [ ] Verify custom URL appears in browser address bar (linkedin.com/in/[your-claimed-url])

### 2. Desktop Logged-Out View

- [ ] Open browser in incognito/private mode
- [ ] Navigate to: linkedin.com/in/[your-claimed-url]
- [ ] Verify your profile loads (check LinkedIn's privacy settings if it doesn't)
- [ ] Check what information is visible to non-logged-in visitors (headline, about fold)
- [ ] Note: Contact email visibility depends on your privacy settings — logged-out users may not see it

### 3. Mobile App View

This is critical — 60%+ of LinkedIn traffic is mobile. Verify truncation points:

- [ ] Open LinkedIn mobile app on your phone
- [ ] Navigate to your profile
- [ ] **Headline truncation:** Check how much of your headline is visible before "...more"
  - Verify the visible portion makes sense standalone
  - Confirm "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" appears in the visible portion
- [ ] **About fold:** Check how much of your about section is visible before "see more"
  - Verify the visible portion works as a hook
  - Confirm it ends at a natural break (not mid-sentence)

### 4. Contact Email Discoverability

- [ ] Click your "Contact info" button
- [ ] Confirm **dan@pattern158.solutions** appears
- [ ] Confirm visibility setting is "Anyone" (or your chosen setting)
- [ ] Check the About section text — confirm **dan@pattern158.solutions** appears near the end

### 5. Custom URL Functionality

- [ ] Test your custom URL: Open browser and navigate to **linkedin.com/in/[your-claimed-url]**
- [ ] Confirm it loads your profile without redirect errors
- [ ] Share this URL with a friend/colleague and ask them to test it

### 6. Cross-Platform Consistency Check

Verify your professional identity is consistent across platforms:

- [ ] **LinkedIn headline** matches **GitHub bio** positioning (both lead with engineering identity)
- [ ] **LinkedIn custom URL** aligns with **pattern158.solutions domain** (brand consistency)
- [ ] **LinkedIn email** (dan@pattern158.solutions) matches **website contact** email
- [ ] **LinkedIn about section** doesn't contradict **pattern158.solutions exhibits** (e.g., don't claim expertise you haven't demonstrated on the site)

### 7. Profile Completeness

Check LinkedIn's "Profile Strength" indicator:

- [ ] LinkedIn should show "All-Star" or equivalent profile completeness status
- [ ] If not All-Star, check LinkedIn's suggestions for missing sections (photo, experience, education, skills)

## Rollback Plan

If you encounter issues or want to revert changes:

### Immediate Rollback (Same Session)

- [ ] **Headline/About:** Click Edit on the section and paste back your original text (from backup you created in Pre-Flight Checks)
- [ ] **Contact email:** Click "Contact info" > Edit > restore original email or remove dan@pattern158.solutions
- [ ] **Custom URL:** You can change it back, but this counts as one of your 5 modifications in 6 months — use sparingly

### Post-Session Rollback

If you notice issues hours or days later:

- [ ] LinkedIn allows re-editing of headline and about at any time (no limits)
- [ ] Custom URL can be changed up to 5 times in 6 months — if you've already used one change to claim the new URL, you have 4 remaining to revert or adjust
- [ ] Contact email can be updated immediately (no limits)

### Rollback Considerations

- [ ] **Headline/About:** Zero risk — edit as many times as needed
- [ ] **Custom URL:** Limited changes (5 per 6 months) — be thoughtful before reverting
- [ ] **Contact email:** Zero risk — update anytime
- [ ] **Open to Work:** Can toggle on/off anytime

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Headline or About Truncated

**Symptom:** Text gets cut off when pasted into LinkedIn

**Solution:**
1. Check actual character limit in LinkedIn editor (may differ from research specs)
2. Return to deliverables and trim content to fit actual limit
3. Re-paste trimmed content

### Issue: Custom URL Already Taken

**Symptom:** LinkedIn shows "pattern158" is unavailable

**Solution:**
1. Try fallback URLs in order: dan-novak, dannovak
2. If all fallbacks are taken, create your own variation (e.g., pattern158solutions, dannovak158)
3. Document which URL you claimed for verification

### Issue: Contact Email Not Visible to Recruiters

**Symptom:** You or a friend cannot see your email when viewing your profile

**Solution:**
1. Check visibility setting: Contact info > Edit > Email visibility should be "Anyone"
2. Check LinkedIn privacy settings (Settings > Visibility > Profile viewing options)
3. Verify email is also in About text (some recruiters never click "Contact info")

### Issue: Formatting Lost in About Section

**Symptom:** Line breaks or paragraphs don't appear correctly

**Solution:**
1. LinkedIn preserves single line breaks — verify you have blank lines between paragraphs in source text
2. If bullets or unicode characters don't render, remove them and use plain text
3. Re-paste and verify in editor preview before saving

### Issue: Mobile Truncation Worse Than Expected

**Symptom:** More of your headline/about gets cut off on mobile than you anticipated

**Solution:**
1. The ~60 char headline and ~300 char about truncation points are estimates
2. Use mobile app to verify actual truncation
3. Edit content to front-load keywords if needed
4. Ensure truncated portion still makes sense standalone

### Issue: Open to Work Settings Not Saving

**Symptom:** "Recruiter-only" setting reverts to "All LinkedIn members" or doesn't save

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have a complete profile (All-Star status) — incomplete profiles may have limited Open to Work access
2. Try using LinkedIn desktop site instead of mobile app
3. Clear browser cache and try again

## Cross-Platform Consistency Reference

After completing LinkedIn updates, verify alignment with other platforms:

### LinkedIn ↔ pattern158.solutions

- **Brand:** LinkedIn custom URL (pattern158) matches domain (pattern158.solutions)
- **Email:** LinkedIn contact (dan@pattern158.solutions) matches website contact
- **Positioning:** LinkedIn headline (Senior Full-Stack Engineer) matches website hero (engineering-first identity)
- **Evidence:** LinkedIn about section references exhibits on pattern158.solutions (GM Investigation, SCORM Debugger, etc.) — ensure claims are verifiable

### LinkedIn ↔ GitHub

- **Identity:** LinkedIn headline (engineering) matches GitHub bio (engineering)
- **Tech stack:** LinkedIn keywords (React, TypeScript, Node.js) match GitHub repository languages and README content
- **Links:** LinkedIn profile links to pattern158.solutions, which links to GitHub (closed loop)
- **Username note:** GitHub username is "novakda" (legacy), LinkedIn custom URL is "pattern158" (current brand) — this is intentional, not an inconsistency

### LinkedIn ↔ Resume

If you have a resume/CV, verify consistency:

- **Job titles:** LinkedIn Experience section should match resume titles exactly (no title inflation)
- **Dates:** LinkedIn employment dates should match resume dates
- **Achievements:** LinkedIn bullets should align with resume bullets (can be briefer on LinkedIn)

## Next Steps

After completing all Phase 23 changes:

1. **Document your URL choice:** Record which custom URL you claimed (pattern158, dan-novak, or dannovak) for future reference

2. **Monitor profile views:** LinkedIn shows who's viewed your profile — track if views increase after updates

3. **Phase 24 prep:** The next phase will add Featured section links to pattern158.solutions exhibits

4. **Recruiter outreach:** With optimized headline and about section, you're now more discoverable in recruiter searches for "Senior Full-Stack Engineer React TypeScript"

## Checklist Summary
