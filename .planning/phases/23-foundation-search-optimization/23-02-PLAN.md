<objective>
Document the custom URL strategy and contact email placement, then create consolidated LinkedIn UI instructions for applying all Phase 23 profile changes.

Purpose: PROF-03 (custom URL) and PROF-04 (contact email) are operational items that need strategy documentation and step-by-step instructions. The consolidated instructions document ties all Phase 23 deliverables together into an actionable checklist the user follows in the LinkedIn UI.

Output: URL/contact strategy document and a consolidated instructions document covering all 4 Phase 23 profile changes.

  <name>Task 1: Document Custom URL Strategy and Contact Email Placement</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/23-foundation-search-optimization/deliverables/url-and-contact.md</files>
  <action>
Create the url-and-contact.md deliverable documenting the custom URL claiming strategy and contact email placement plan.

**Custom URL (PROF-03):**

Per CONTEXT.md, the priority order is:
1. "pattern158" (brand-aligned, connects to pattern158.solutions domain)
2. "dan-novak" (name-based fallback)
3. "dannovak" (no hyphen variant)

Document for each option:
- The full URL that would result (linkedin.com/in/pattern158, etc.)
- Why this choice (brand consistency across platforms / name recognition)
- Cross-platform consistency check (does this match GitHub username novakda? pattern158.solutions domain?)

**LinkedIn custom URL constraints (from research):**
- 3-100 characters
- No spaces, symbols, or special characters
- Cannot contain the word "linkedin"
- Case insensitive
- Can modify up to 5 times in 6 months

**Contact Email (PROF-04):**

Per CONTEXT.md, dan@pattern158.solutions goes in TWO places:
1. LinkedIn Contact Info section (authoritative source — accessed via "Contact info" button)
2. About section close (visible without clicking — already handled in Plan 01's about.md)

Document:
- The exact email: dan@pattern158.solutions
- Where it goes (Contact Info section + About section CTA)
- Why dual placement (Contact Info for official records, About for recruiter visibility since many recruiters only skim the About section)

**Deliverable format:**
```

## Contact Email Placement

- [What to do in LinkedIn UI]

### Placement 2: About Section Close
- [Already included in about.md deliverable — reference only]

## Verification Notes
- [ ] User: Check if "pattern158" is available (LinkedIn shows availability immediately)
- [ ] User: If unavailable, try fallbacks in order
- [ ] User: Verify email displays correctly in Contact Info after saving

  <name>Task 2: Create Consolidated LinkedIn UI Application Instructions</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/23-foundation-search-optimization/deliverables/instructions.md</files>
  <action>
Create the instructions.md deliverable with step-by-step LinkedIn UI instructions for applying ALL Phase 23 changes. This is the user's action checklist.

**Structure the instructions in this order (recommended application sequence):**

1. **Pre-flight checks** (before making any changes):
   - Open LinkedIn profile editor
   - Verify current headline character limit (is it still 220?)
   - Verify current about section character limit (is it still 2600?)
   - Note current headline and about text (screenshot or copy for rollback)
   - If limits differ from research specs, STOP and adjust deliverables before pasting

2. **Step 1: Claim Custom URL** (do first — URL changes have a 5-per-6-month limit):
   - Navigate to: Profile > Edit public profile & URL (right rail)
   - Click edit icon next to current URL
   - Enter "pattern158" — check availability
   - If unavailable, try "dan-novak", then "dannovak"
   - Save
   - Record which URL was claimed

3. **Step 2: Update Contact Email**:
   - Navigate to: Profile > Contact info (click "Contact info" link)
   - Add or update email to dan@pattern158.solutions
   - Set visibility to "Your connections" or "Anyone" (Claude recommends "Anyone" for recruiter discovery — document reasoning)
   - Save

4. **Step 3: Update Headline**:
   - Navigate to: Profile > Edit intro (pencil icon)
   - Clear current headline
   - Copy headline from deliverables/headline.md (the "Copy-Paste Ready" section)
   - Paste into headline field
   - Verify character count accepted (no truncation warning)
   - Save

5. **Step 4: Update About Section**:
   - Navigate to: Profile > About section > Edit (pencil icon)
   - Clear current about text
   - Copy about text from deliverables/about.md (the "Copy-Paste Ready" section)
   - Paste into about field
   - Verify formatting renders correctly (line breaks, any bullets)
   - Verify character count accepted
   - Save

6. **Post-flight verification**:
   - View profile as public (not in edit mode)
   - Verify headline displays correctly
   - Verify about section displays with correct "see more" fold
   - Open LinkedIn mobile app
   - Check headline truncation on mobile — does it make sense at the fold?
   - Check about section "see more" — does the hook work standalone?
   - Check custom URL by visiting linkedin.com/in/[chosen-url]
   - Verify dan@pattern158.solutions appears in Contact Info
   - Cross-reference: Does LinkedIn profile headline match GitHub bio positioning? (Both should lead with engineering identity)

7. **Rollback plan**:
   - If any issues: LinkedIn allows immediate re-editing of headline and about
   - Custom URL: Can be changed up to 5 times in 6 months
   - Contact email: Can be updated immediately

**Deliverable format:**
```
