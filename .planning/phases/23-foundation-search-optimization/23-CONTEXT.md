# Phase 23: Foundation & Search Optimization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Optimize LinkedIn headline, about section, custom URL, and contact email for recruiter search discovery. Deliverables: rewritten headline (PROF-01), rewritten about/summary (PROF-02), custom URL claimed (PROF-03), contact email updated (PROF-04). All changes are manual via LinkedIn UI — deliverables are copy-paste-ready text.

## Implementation Decisions

### Headline positioning
- Lead with "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" in the visible ~60 characters on mobile
- Claude's discretion on what follows in the visible portion (keyword optimization)
- No eLearning/SCORM keywords in headline — keep it pure engineering
- No employment status in headline — use LinkedIn's "Open to Work" badge separately
- Claude's discretion on: brand mention (pattern158.solutions), keyword mix for extended portion (~160 chars after fold), whether to include years of experience, tone (technical authority vs narrative hook)

### About section voice & structure
- First person, narrative tone — storytelling that weaves career arc
- Hybrid narrative arc: Differentiator hook → Engineering identity & stack breadth → Key proof points → Forward-looking (transition as opportunity) → Contact CTA
- NTSB/forensic angle as methodology descriptor — "I bring forensic rigor to every system I build" framing, not as the opening hook or standalone story
- Transition framed as opportunity (building pattern158.solutions) — Claude decides candor level
- dan@pattern158.solutions included at the end as contact CTA
- Technologies woven into narrative naturally, no separate tech stack list
- GP Strategies tenure reframed as variety — "equivalent of 5+ distinct engineering roles," NOT a rename to Cornerstone (Cornerstone is an LMS product used by clients, not Dan's employer)
- Close with specific "looking for" statement: modern web platforms, product-focused teams, remote or hybrid, mid-to-large companies preferred
- 2024-2026 work (MCAPS AILT, ContentAIQ) leads — most recent = most relevant
- GM investigation as one of several highlights, not the centerpiece
- Single-employer perception addressed in About AND Experience (both approaches)
- AVOID: "passionate" clichés, soft skill listings ("team player, problem solver, self-starter"), generic buzzwords
- Claude's discretion on: exact hook content, formatting (unicode bullets vs prose), WCAG mention placement, pattern158.solutions reference level, tone calibration for LinkedIn audience, proof point selection, location mention

### Keyword strategy
- Primary target title: Senior Full-Stack Engineer
- Vue.js is strongest frontend framework (more confident than React, prefers it) — Claude decides Vue vs React ordering for search optimization
- React as strong secondary — capable and ready to use, just not preferred
- Open to any modern framework — Next.js (production experience via ContentAIQ), Nuxt.js (personal exploration)
- Core stack: Vue.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js
- Include: Databases (SQL/NoSQL), Testing/CI-CD as searchable keywords
- AI/LLM integration as emerging keyword (ContentAIQ, MCAPS AILT = real production experience)
- WCAG/accessibility as engineering competency, NOT as testing role
- System architecture: demonstrated through experience, not claimed as title (de facto, not formal)
- Power Platform: minimal mention, last-resort territory — do NOT optimize for it
- Cloud (AWS/Azure): limited experience (Cognito, log troubleshooting) — don't feature as keyword
- Custom URL: try "pattern158" first, fallback to "dan-novak"
- Contact email: dan@pattern158.solutions in both Contact Info AND About section close
- No salary info on public profile — Claude decides private settings recommendation
- No specific target companies — optimize broadly for role type

### Keyword exclusions (DO NOT optimize for)
- Pure eLearning/instructional design roles
- Legacy tech (.NET/C# maintenance) roles
- WordPress/CMS roles
- QA/Testing-only roles
- Management/non-coding roles
- DevOps/SRE-only roles
- Mobile-only (iOS/Android native) roles
- Data engineering/ML roles
- Billable-hours-driven consulting companies — quality optimization, not time tracking

### Identity framing
- Engineering-first, eLearning as proof-of-depth not pigeonhole
- Mixed feelings about eLearning: deep expertise and proud of it, but ready for broader engineering work
- EdTech roles acceptable IF modern tech stack (React/Vue, not legacy SCORM authoring)
- Recent 2024-2026 work leads the identity — proves currency and modern relevance
- pattern158.solutions framed honestly: static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS currently, migration to modern stack planned — Claude decides framing (content-focused vs active project)
- Single-employer perception: addressed head-on in About + structured Experience entries
- Layoff posture: Claude decides (builder-in-transition vs available-and-ready)

### Core identity traits (must come through)
- **Toolmaker**: builds tools and automation that make everyone's jobs easier
- **Trench-tested**: works in the same environments as users, knows where the friction points are
- **Quality over speed**: does things right, cares about craft (code quality, documentation, testing)
- **Evidence-based**: documents, traces, and proves — NTSB methodology extends beyond the GM case
- **Cross-functional**: works across teams, understands business context, not just code
- **Self-directed**: effective working autonomously, doesn't need hand-holding
- **Rising tide**: "I want to be a rising tide that lifts all boats" — builds leverage, not just features

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "I'm often in the trenches and am quite familiar with where the friction points are — I built automation where software pisses me off and likely annoys others too"
- The "rising tide that lifts all boats" metaphor — consider weaving this into About section or keeping for future content
- Vue.js preference is genuine and strong — more confident than React — but market pragmatism means React should still be prominent
- GP Strategies ≠ Cornerstone. GP Strategies was the employer. Cornerstone OnDemand is an LMS product that client companies used. Do not conflate these.
- pattern158.solutions is currently static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, not a modern framework — don't claim Astro/React/Vue for the site itself
