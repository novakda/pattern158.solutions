<objective>
Verify and polish the NTSB investigation structure and metrics highlighting across the 7 already-conforming exhibits (a, e, j, k, l, m, n), with extra attention on Phase 12 Rustici-targeted exhibits.

Purpose: These 7 exhibits already use the section-heading div pattern but need structural verification, section title consistency review, and metrics highlighting enhancement. The 3 Phase 12 exhibits (e, m, n) receive extra attention since they're newest and most relevant to the Rustici opportunity. Exhibit-k has a "1b." section numbering anomaly to resolve.

Output: 7 polished exhibit HTML files with verified consistent structure and highlighted metrics.

  <name>Task 1: Polish Phase 12 exhibits (e, m, n) with extra structural and content review</name>

  </files>
  <action>
These 3 exhibits were created in Phase 12 and are the newest. Per user decision, they get extra attention. Already use section-heading pattern. Review and improve:

For each Phase 12 exhibit:

1. Read the complete file
2. **Structure audit:**
   - Verify section numbering is sequential (1., 2., 3., ... N.)
   - Verify section titles follow consistent naming: Background, Personnel Involved, Sequence of Events, Findings, Probable Cause, Outcome, Technologies
   - Ensure each section's content is wrapped in `<div class="background-content">` where appropriate
   - Ensure `<section class="report-section"><div class="container">` wrapping is consistent
3. **Content quality check against GM Investigation (exhibit-j) tone:**
   - Verify NTSB voice level (investigation terminology, not marketing)
   - Check for "challenge → approach → solution → results" narrative flow within the structure
   - Ensure factual precision — no embellishment, claims traceable
4. **Metrics highlighting:**
   - Identify all quantifiable results in each exhibit
   - Wrap standout metrics in `<span class="key-fact">` where not already done
   - Use `<strong>` for emphasis on results statements
   - exhibit-e (CSBB Dispatch): timeline metrics ("Built 2011, 5 years before Rustici Content Controller"), user/deployment scale
   - exhibit-m (SCORM Debugger): bug detection metrics, tool adoption scale, TASBot methodology results
   - exhibit-n (BP Learning Platform): Rustici Content Controller integration specifics, platform metrics
5. **Rustici signaling review (per CONTEXT.md discretion):**
   - Ensure Rustici-relevant technology mentions are present but not forced
   - Verify the positioning is accurate per Phase 12 decisions (no "budget substitute" language)
  </action>
  <verify>
For each file:
- grep -c 'key-fact' exhibits/exhibit-{e,m,n}.html (should have at least 1 per file)
- grep -c 'section-title' exhibits/exhibit-{e,m,n}.html (should be >= 6 per file for standard sections)
- Verify no "budget substitute" or "budget alternative" language: grep -i 'budget' exhibits/exhibit-{e,m,n}.html should return 0
  </verify>
  <done>
All 3 Phase 12 exhibits have verified NTSB structure, highlighted metrics, consistent section naming, and accurate Rustici-relevant positioning. No prohibited framing language present.
  </done>

These 4 exhibits already have strong structure. Lighter touch — verify consistency and enhance metrics.

For each exhibit:

1. Read the complete file
2. **Exhibit-a (Electric Boat — formatting benchmark):**
   - Already gold standard for formatting. Verify metrics are highlighted with key-fact spans.
   - Key metrics to verify highlighting: "574 emails", "49 EB personnel", "7 years", "120 years", "287 emails" peak year, "Five critical issues", "1,000+ courses"
   - Ensure all section titles use section-title span pattern (already confirmed, verify)
   - No structural changes needed unless inconsistencies found

3. **Exhibit-j (GM Investigation — content benchmark):**
   - Already gold standard for content/tone. Verify metrics are highlighted.
   - Key metrics to verify highlighting: "19% of launched lessons", "four times", "10,000 courses", "five system failures"
   - Verify Swiss cheese model language is prominent (added in Phase 12)
   - No structural changes needed unless inconsistencies found

4. **Exhibit-k (Career Documentation Refactoring):**
   - Has section "1b." numbering anomaly — renumber to sequential: if 1b follows 1, make it 2 and renumber all subsequent sections
   - Verify section titles follow standard naming conventions
   - Highlight quantifiable metrics (refactoring scope, time savings, etc.)

5. **Exhibit-l (Power Platform Audit):**
   - Verify structure completeness — currently has 6 sections. Consider whether Outcome/Recommendations section is needed between Probable Cause and Technologies
   - Has duplicate class attributes: `<table class="resolution-table" class="impact-tags-container">` — fix by keeping only the correct class
   - Also: `<div class="background-content" class="solution-detail">` — fix duplicate class attribute
   - Highlight metrics: "Five foundational gaps", severity ratings, requirements chain depth
   - Ensure "Diagnosis as Deliverable" messaging is prominent
  </action>
  <verify>
- grep '1b' exhibits/exhibit-k.html (should return 0 — renumbered)
- grep 'class=.*class=' exhibits/exhibit-l.html (should return 0 — no duplicate class attributes)
- grep -c 'key-fact' exhibits/exhibit-{a,j,k,l}.html (each should have at least 1)
  </verify>
  <done>
All 4 exhibits have verified consistent structure, no markup anomalies, and highlighted quantifiable metrics. Exhibit-k renumbered sequentially. Exhibit-l duplicate class attributes fixed.
  </done>
</task>

After both tasks complete:
1. All 7 exhibits use consistent section-heading markup
2. Section titles follow standard naming conventions across all 7
3. Each exhibit has quantifiable metrics highlighted with key-fact/strong
4. No duplicate class attributes in any file
5. No prohibited framing language in Phase 12 exhibits
6. HTML validates (no unclosed tags, proper nesting)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 7 exhibits structurally verified and polished
- Phase 12 exhibits received extra review attention
- Metrics prominently highlighted for 30-second scan
- Zero markup anomalies
</success_criteria>
