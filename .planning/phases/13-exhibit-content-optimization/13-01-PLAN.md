<objective>
Standardize the NTSB investigation structure and highlight quantifiable metrics across the 7 older-format exhibits (b, c, d, f, g, h, i).

Purpose: These 7 exhibits use inconsistent heading markup (h2 tags, "Section N" numbering, or no section numbers at all). Standardizing to the section-heading div pattern with section-number + section-title spans (matching exhibit-a format) ensures visual and structural consistency. Additionally, mine each exhibit for quantifiable results and ensure they are prominently highlighted.

Output: 7 updated exhibit HTML files with consistent section heading markup and highlighted metrics.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure exhibits g, h, i from h2-only to section-heading pattern</name>
  <files>
    exhibits/exhibit-g.html
    exhibits/exhibit-h.html
    exhibits/exhibit-i.html
  </files>
  <action>
These 3 exhibits use bare h2 tags with no section-number/section-title structure. Convert them to match exhibit-a's pattern.

**Before (current pattern in g, h, i):**
```html
<section class="report-section">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Background</h2>
```

**After (target pattern matching exhibit-a):**
```html
<section class="report-section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="section-heading">
            <span class="section-number">1.</span>
            <span class="section-title">Background</span>
        </div>
```

For each exhibit:

1. Read the exhibit file completely
2. Identify all h2 and h3 section headings
3. Replace each top-level h2 with the section-heading div pattern, assigning sequential numbers (1., 2., 3., etc.)
4. Keep h3 sub-headings as-is (they work within the report-section structure)
5. Wrap content in `<div class="background-content">` where missing (check exhibit-a for which sections use this wrapper)
6. Ensure each section is wrapped in `<section class="report-section"><div class="container">`

**Section mapping guidance (flexible per exhibit content):**
- Background = 1.
- Personnel = 2.
- Investigation/Challenge/Analysis sections = 3., 4., etc.
- Findings = next number
- Evidence/Outcome = next number
- Technologies = last number

Also highlight quantifiable metrics in each exhibit:
- exhibit-g (SunTrust AWARE): Look for user counts, integration metrics, deployment scale in EmailArchive
- exhibit-h (Metal Additive Manufacturing): Look for course counts, timeline metrics
- exhibit-i (TD Bank Accessibility): Already has "Quantitative Scale" section — verify metrics are prominently displayed with strong tags or key-fact spans

Use `<span class="key-fact">` for standout metrics and `<strong>` for emphasis, matching exhibit-a's patterns.
  </action>
  <verify>
For each of the 3 files, run:
- grep -c 'section-heading' exhibits/exhibit-{g,h,i}.html (should return >0 for each)
- grep -c '<h2>' exhibits/exhibit-{g,h,i}.html (should return 0 — all converted to section-heading pattern, except h3 sub-headings which stay)
- Validate HTML structure is well-formed (no unclosed tags)
  </verify>
  <done>
All 3 exhibits (g, h, i) use section-heading div with section-number + section-title spans. Zero bare h2 tags remain at top-level section headings. Metrics are highlighted with key-fact spans or strong tags where data exists.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Standardize exhibits b, c, d, f from "Section N" to "N." numbering and add section-title spans</name>
  <files>
    exhibits/exhibit-b.html
    exhibits/exhibit-c.html
    exhibits/exhibit-d.html
    exhibits/exhibit-f.html
  </files>
  <action>
These 4 exhibits use `<span class="section-number">Section 1</span>` with separate `<h2>Title</h2>` elements. Convert them to match exhibit-a's consolidated pattern.

**Before (current pattern in b, c, d, f):**
```html
<div class="section-heading">
    <span class="section-number">Section 1</span>
</div>
<h2>Background</h2>
```
OR (some variations exist — check each file):
```html
<span class="section-number">Section 1</span>
<h2>Background</h2>
```

**After (target pattern matching exhibit-a):**
```html
<div class="section-heading">
    <span class="section-number">1.</span>
    <span class="section-title">Background</span>
</div>
```

For each exhibit:

1. Read the exhibit file completely
2. Find each `<span class="section-number">Section N</span>` and its associated `<h2>` heading
3. Replace with the consolidated section-heading div containing both section-number ("N.") and section-title spans
4. Remove the now-redundant h2 tag
5. Keep h3 sub-headings as-is (they remain for subsection structure)
6. Ensure content is wrapped in `<div class="background-content">` where appropriate

Also highlight quantifiable metrics:
- exhibit-b (Leadership Recognition): Recognition cascade frequency, email counts, personnel involved
- exhibit-c (Content Refresh): Already has "1,216-Lesson" and "600+ Hours" — verify these are in key-fact spans
- exhibit-d (Wells Fargo): "100+ Course" migration, look for additional metrics in EmailArchive
- exhibit-f (HSBC): Look for deployment scale, years of engagement, course counts

Use `<span class="key-fact">` and `<strong>` matching exhibit-a's patterns.
  </action>
  <verify>
For each of the 4 files, run:
- grep 'Section [0-9]' exhibits/exhibit-{b,c,d,f}.html (should return NO matches — old format eliminated)
- grep -c 'section-title' exhibits/exhibit-{b,c,d,f}.html (should return >0 for each)
- grep -c '<h2>' exhibits/exhibit-{b,c,d,f}.html (should return 0 at top-level section headings)
  </verify>
  <done>
All 4 exhibits (b, c, d, f) use "N." numbering format with section-title spans. Zero instances of "Section N" format remain. All top-level h2 headings replaced with section-heading pattern. Metrics highlighted where data exists.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. All 7 exhibits use consistent section-heading markup: `<div class="section-heading"><span class="section-number">N.</span><span class="section-title">Title</span></div>`
2. Zero instances of `Section [0-9]` pattern across all 7 files
3. Zero bare h2 section headings (h3 sub-headings are acceptable)
4. Each exhibit has at least one quantifiable metric highlighted with key-fact span or strong tag
5. HTML validates (no unclosed tags, proper nesting)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 7 exhibits structurally match exhibit-a's heading pattern
- Metrics visible and highlighted in each exhibit
- No regressions in existing content (all blockquotes, timelines, tables preserved)
</success_criteria>
