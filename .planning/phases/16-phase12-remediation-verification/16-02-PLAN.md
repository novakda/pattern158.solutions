<objective>
Create the Phase 12 directory with retroactive VERIFICATION.md to formally un-orphan all 8 CONTENT requirements, then verify the complete E2E flow from homepage through all 14 exhibits.

Purpose: Phase 12 was executed as a quick task without GSD artifacts. All 8 CONTENT requirements are confirmed delivered in the codebase (commit c3a215c, integration checker confirmed) but lack formal VERIFICATION.md documentation. This plan creates that documentation and performs final E2E verification now that Plan 01 has fixed the testimonials.html integration gap.

Output: Phase 12 VERIFICATION.md with pass/fail evidence for each requirement, confirmed E2E flows

  <action>
Create the directory `.planning/phases/12-rustici-content/` and write `12-VERIFICATION.md`.

For each of the 8 CONTENT requirements, perform codebase verification and record evidence:

**CONTENT-05 (SCORM Debugger exhibit):**
- Verify exhibits/exhibit-m.html exists and contains TASBot methodology content
- Verify "Rustici" appears in exhibit content (gap callout)
- Grep for "exhibit-m" in testimonials.html (should exist after Plan 01 fix)
- Record: PASS/FAIL with file paths and line references

**CONTENT-06 (CSBB Dispatch exhibit):**
- Verify exhibits/exhibit-e.html exists and contains "Built 2011, 5 years before Rustici Content Controller" or equivalent
- Grep for "exhibit-e" in testimonials.html
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-07 (BP Learning Platform exhibit):**
- Verify exhibits/exhibit-n.html exists and contains Rustici Content Controller integration content
- Grep for "exhibit-n" in testimonials.html
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-08 (Three positioning narratives on portfolio):**
- Grep portfolio.html for "Three Lenses" or positioning narrative section
- Verify 3 distinct narrative blocks exist
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-09 (GM Investigation strengthened):**
- Grep exhibits/exhibit-j.html for "Swiss cheese" and "three-angle" or "multi-angle"
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-10 (Homepage Five Core Influences):**
- Grep index.html for "Five Core Influences" or "Influences" section
- Verify content has application context (not just a list)
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-11 (Cross-references updated):**
- Grep philosophy.html for references to new exhibits (E, M, or N)
- Verify sitemap.xml includes exhibit-e, exhibit-m, exhibit-n URLs
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

**CONTENT-12 (No "budget substitute" language):**
- Grep all HTML files for "budget substitute", "budget alternative", "cheap alternative"
- Must return zero results
- Record: PASS/FAIL with evidence

# Phase 12 Verification: Rustici-Targeted Content

**Context:** Phase 12 was executed as a quick task (commit c3a215c) without GSD plan/summary/verification artifacts. This retroactive verification confirms requirement satisfaction through codebase evidence.

## Requirements

### CONTENT-05: SCORM Debugger Exhibit
**Status:** PASS/FAIL
**Evidence:**
- {file path}: {what was found}
- {grep result}

[repeat for each requirement]

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Homepage -> Field Reports -> Exhibits
{verification steps and results}

### Flow 2: Homepage -> Portfolio -> Exhibits
{verification steps and results}
```

Use `grep` commands via Bash tool to gather actual evidence. Do not fabricate evidence — report what is actually found.

1. File exists: .planning/phases/12-rustici-content/12-VERIFICATION.md
2. All 8 CONTENT requirement IDs appear in the file
3. Each requirement has a PASS/FAIL status with evidence
4. E2E flow verification section exists
  </verify>
  <done>Phase 12 VERIFICATION.md exists with codebase-verified evidence for all 8 CONTENT requirements, each showing PASS status with specific file paths and content evidence</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify E2E exhibit discovery flows and update REQUIREMENTS.md</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Perform E2E verification of both exhibit discovery paths:

**Flow 1: Homepage -> Field Reports -> All 14 Exhibits**
1. Grep index.html for link to testimonials.html (Field Reports button)
2. Count exhibit-card elements in testimonials.html — must be 14
3. Extract all exhibit link hrefs from testimonials.html
4. Verify each exhibit file exists in exhibits/ directory
5. Verify the order is A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N

**Flow 2: Homepage -> Portfolio -> All 14 Exhibits**
1. Grep index.html for link to portfolio.html
2. Grep portfolio.html for all exhibit links
3. Verify all 14 exhibits are reachable from portfolio.html

**Update REQUIREMENTS.md:**
After verification passes, update REQUIREMENTS.md:
- Change CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12 from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Update traceability table: change "Pending Verification" to "Complete" for all CONTENT requirements
- Update coverage count

Do NOT change NAV or A11Y requirements (those are for Phases 14-15).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. grep -c "exhibit-card" testimonials.html returns 14
2. All 14 exhibit HTML files exist in exhibits/ directory
3. REQUIREMENTS.md shows CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12 as [x] checked
4. Traceability table shows "Complete" for all CONTENT requirements
  </verify>
  <done>Both E2E flows verified working (14/14 exhibits accessible), REQUIREMENTS.md updated to reflect CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12 as complete</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. .planning/phases/12-rustici-content/12-VERIFICATION.md exists with all 8 requirements verified
2. All 8 CONTENT requirements show PASS in verification
3. E2E flows confirmed: both Homepage->Field Reports and Homepage->Portfolio reach all 14 exhibits
4. REQUIREMENTS.md updated: CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12 marked complete
5. Milestone audit gaps are fully addressed
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 8 CONTENT requirements formally verified with codebase evidence
- No orphaned requirements remain
- E2E flows confirmed working for both entry paths (Field Reports + Portfolio)
- REQUIREMENTS.md reflects current verified state
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-phase12-remediation-verification/16-02-SUMMARY.md`
