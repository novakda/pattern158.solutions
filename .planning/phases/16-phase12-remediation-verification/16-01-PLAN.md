<objective>
Redesign exhibit cards on testimonials.html with improved visual hierarchy and add missing E, M, N cards.

Purpose: The CONTEXT.md decisions require an improved card design that is "cleaner/simpler" with "better visual hierarchy" than the current cards. All 14 exhibit cards must be retrofitted to the improved design, not just the 3 new ones. Cards must work in both light and dark mode.

Output: testimonials.html with 14 redesigned exhibit cards, css/main.css with updated card styles

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign exhibit card CSS for improved visual hierarchy</name>
  <files>css/main.css</files>
  <action>
Update the .exhibit-card CSS styles in main.css to create a cleaner, simpler card design with better visual hierarchy. The current cards have blockquotes, resolution tables, context boxes, and impact tags all competing visually. The improved design should:

1. **Cleaner card structure:** Reduce visual noise -- the card should scan quickly with a clear information hierarchy: exhibit label + client + date at top, title prominent, then a concise context/quote section, then impact tags, then the link.

2. **Better visual hierarchy:**
   - Exhibit label should be small and subtle (badge/pill style)
   - Client name should be prominent (secondary heading weight)
   - Date should be de-emphasized (muted text)
   - Title (h3) should be the primary focal point
   - Impact tags should be compact and scannable
   - The "View Full Investigation Report" link should be a clear CTA

3. **Light and dark mode:** All new/modified styles must have appropriate dark mode overrides in the `[data-theme="dark"]` section. Use existing design tokens (--color-surface, --color-background-alt, --color-text, --color-text-muted, --color-primary, --color-border, etc.).

4. **Responsive:** Cards should work well at both desktop (1200px) and mobile (375px). Follow existing responsive patterns in the CSS.

5. **Keep existing card variant classes working:** The `detail-exhibit` class is used on cards with extra content (context blocks, tables, blockquotes). Ensure both simple and detail cards look consistent.

Do NOT add animations or transitions beyond what already exists in the site CSS. Follow the existing design token system -- no hardcoded colors.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Open testimonials.html in browser, verify cards have improved visual hierarchy
    - Check dark mode toggle works correctly on all card elements
    - Check mobile viewport (375px) renders cards properly
    - Verify no hardcoded colors -- all values use var() tokens
    - `grep -c 'exhibit-card' css/main.css` shows card style rules exist
  </verify>
  <done>Exhibit card CSS updated with cleaner design, proper dark mode support, responsive layout, all using design tokens</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Retrofit all 14 exhibit cards and add E, M, N to testimonials.html</name>
  <files>testimonials.html</files>
  <action>
Update ALL 14 exhibit cards on testimonials.html to use a consistent, improved HTML structure. Per CONTEXT.md: "Retrofit ALL exhibit cards on testimonials.html to the improved design (not just E, M, N)."

For each of the 14 exhibit cards (A through N):

1. **Ensure consistent HTML structure across all cards:**
   - exhibit-header with exhibit-label, exhibit-client, exhibit-date
   - h3 exhibit-title
   - Optional: blockquote section (for cards that have testimonial quotes)
   - Optional: exhibit-context div (for cards without direct quotes -- use for E, M, N)
   - impact-tags div with relevant tags (first/most important tag gets `highlight` class)
   - exhibit-link anchor to the full investigation report

2. **Add 3 missing exhibit cards:**
   - **Exhibit E (CSBB Dispatch):** Between D and F. Client: "GP Strategies (Energy Utility Clients)". Date: "2011-2016+". Title: "CSBB Dispatch: Cross-Domain Content Delivery -- Built 5 Years Before Content Controller". Context: Architected cross-domain SCORM dispatch for 7+ energy utility clients, predating Rustici Content Controller by 5 years. Tags: Cross-Domain Architecture (highlight), 7+ Clients, SCORM, GPiLEARN, Rustici Precursor.
   - **Exhibit M (SCORM Debugger):** After Exhibit L in Investigation Reports section. Client: "GP Strategies (Internal Tooling)". Date: "~2019-2020". Title: "SCORM Debugger: TASBot-Inspired QA Automation". Context: Vue.js SCORM debugging tool inspired by TASBot save states, hours to minutes QA improvement. Tags: QA Automation (highlight), Hours to Minutes, Vue.js, SCORM Testing, TASBot Methodology.
   - **Exhibit N (BP Learning Platform):** After Exhibit M. Client: "BP (via Leo Learning / GP Strategies)". Date: "2024". Title: "BP Learning Platform: Federated System Integration". Context: Worked on React/GraphQL platform with Rustici Content Controller, PeopleFluent, Watershed LRS, Amazon Cognito. Tags: Rustici Content Controller (highlight), React/GraphQL, Federated Integration, Pattern Recognition, Material UI.

3. **Consistency check:** Every card should use the `detail-exhibit` modifier class if it has context blocks or resolution tables (not just blockquotes). This visually distinguishes cards with richer detail.

4. **HTML entities:** Use proper entities throughout (&ndash;, &mdash;, &rsquo;, &amp;, &hellip;).

5. **Indentation:** Match existing file indentation (12 spaces for card content, 16 for inner elements).

Card placement per Claude's discretion: maintain current chronological ordering.
