<objective>
Fix the critical integration gap on testimonials.html (Field Reports) by adding exhibit cards for E (CSBB Dispatch), M (SCORM Debugger), and N (BP Learning Platform), and clean up debug/audit scripts from the project root.

Purpose: The milestone audit found testimonials.html showing only 11/14 exhibits, missing all three Rustici-targeted exhibits created in Phase 12. Hiring managers using the Field Reports entry point cannot discover the most strategically relevant content. Additionally, 18 debug/audit scripts were left in the project root from previous phases.

Output: testimonials.html with 14/14 exhibit cards, clean project root

  <name>Task 1: Add exhibit cards for E, M, N to testimonials.html</name>
  <files>testimonials.html</files>
  <action>
Add three new exhibit cards to testimonials.html following the exact pattern of existing cards. The cards must use the same HTML structure as existing exhibit-card divs.

**Exhibit E (CSBB Dispatch)** — Insert between Exhibit D and Exhibit F (after the closing `</div>` of Exhibit D's card, before the `<!-- ===== EXHIBIT F` comment). This is a detail-exhibit (investigation report style):
- Label: "Exhibit E"
- Client: "GP Strategies (Energy Utility Clients)"
- Date: "2011&ndash;2016+"
- Title: "CSBB Dispatch: Cross-Domain Content Delivery — Built 5 Years Before Content Controller"
- Context block (not blockquote — no direct testimonial quote available): "Architected a cross-domain content delivery system serving 7+ energy utility clients through a centralized SCORM dispatch layer. Eliminated the manual zip-and-email deployment cycle. Built in 2011 — five years before Rustici released Content Controller to solve the same problem."
- Impact tags: "Cross-Domain Architecture" (highlight), "7+ Clients Served", "SCORM", "GPiLEARN", "Rustici Precursor"
- Link: exhibits/exhibit-e.html with text "View Full Investigation Report"
- CSS class: `exhibit-card detail-exhibit`

**Exhibit M (SCORM Debugger)** — Insert in the Investigation Reports subsection, after Exhibit L's card (after line 507's closing div, before the closing `</div>` of the exhibits section). This is a detail-exhibit:
- Label: "Exhibit M"
- Client: "GP Strategies (Internal Tooling)"
- Date: "~2019&ndash;2020"
- Title: "SCORM Debugger: TASBot-Inspired QA Automation"
- Context block: "Created a Vue.js SCORM debugging tool inspired by TASBot/speedrunning save states. Reduced QA testing cycles from hours to minutes by enabling instant state capture and restore across gated eLearning courses. The approach that Rustici Engine's testing tools would later address commercially."
- Impact tags: "QA Automation" (highlight), "Hours to Minutes", "Vue.js", "SCORM Testing", "TASBot Methodology"
- Link: exhibits/exhibit-m.html with text "View Investigation Report"
- CSS class: `exhibit-card detail-exhibit`

**Exhibit N (BP Learning Platform)** — Insert after Exhibit M's card in the Investigation Reports subsection:
- Label: "Exhibit N"
- Client: "BP (via Leo Learning / GP Strategies)"
- Date: "2024"
- Title: "BP Learning Platform: Federated System Integration"
- Context block: "Worked on BP's React/GraphQL learning platform integrating Rustici Content Controller, PeopleFluent LMS, Watershed LRS, and Amazon Cognito. Recognized the federated integration pattern from CSBB Dispatch — a decade of pattern evolution from custom-built to commercial ecosystem."
- Impact tags: "Rustici Content Controller" (highlight), "React/GraphQL", "Federated Integration", "Pattern Recognition", "Material UI"
- Link: exhibits/exhibit-n.html with text "View Investigation Report"
- CSS class: `exhibit-card detail-exhibit`

Ensure all HTML entities are correct (&ndash; for en-dashes, &mdash; for em-dashes, &ldquo;/&rdquo; for smart quotes). Match indentation exactly (12 spaces for card content, 16 for inner elements).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Count exhibit-card divs in testimonials.html — must be exactly 14
2. Grep for "exhibit-e.html", "exhibit-m.html", "exhibit-n.html" links — all 3 must be present
3. Verify card order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N
4. Validate HTML — no unclosed tags
  </verify>
  <done>testimonials.html contains 14 exhibit cards in correct A-N order, with working links to all exhibit pages, matching the visual style and HTML structure of existing cards</done>

Delete all 18 debug/audit .mjs scripts from the project root. These are leftover from v1.0, v1.1, and Phase 13 development. They are NOT production assets and are NOT tracked in git (they appear as untracked files in git status).

Run: `rm debug-hamburger.mjs debug-hamburger2.mjs list-check.mjs list-check2.mjs list-context.mjs list-desktop-check.mjs mobile-audit.mjs nav-check.mjs screenshot-detail.mjs screenshot-detail2.mjs screenshot-mobile.mjs screenshot-review.mjs typo-check.mjs uat-phase6.mjs uat-screenshot-footer.mjs verify-contrast.mjs verify-dark-surfaces.mjs visual-audit.mjs`

Also clean up the test-results/ directory if it contains only debug artifacts (screenshots, lighthouse JSON from testing).

Do NOT delete node_modules/ (may be needed for Phase 15 accessibility testing).
Do NOT delete .planning/debug/ directory (planning artifacts stay in .planning/).
  </action>

1. `ls *.mjs` in project root returns no results (or "No such file or directory")
2. git status shows fewer untracked files

1. testimonials.html has exactly 14 exhibit-card elements
2. All exhibit links (A through N) resolve to existing files in exhibits/ directory
3. No .mjs debug scripts remain in project root
4. HTML structure validates — no unclosed tags in added content

<success_criteria>
- testimonials.html shows all 14 exhibits including E (CSBB Dispatch), M (SCORM Debugger), N (BP Learning Platform)
- Project root is clean of debug/audit scripts
- Cards follow identical HTML structure to existing exhibit cards
