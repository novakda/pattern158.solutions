<objective>
Human verification of all layout and spacing changes made in Plans 01 and 02.

Purpose: Layout and spacing are inherently visual — automated checks can verify tokens and overflow, but only human eyes can confirm the spacing "feels" balanced and professional. This checkpoint ensures the GitHub/Linear-density target is achieved.

Output: User approval or issue list for gap closure.

  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of layout and spacing across viewports</name>
  <files>css/main.css</files>
  <action>
Present the user with verification instructions for visual layout review. Plans 01-02 completed:
- Migrated all remaining hardcoded spacing values to design tokens (--space-* system)
- Added --space-ms token (0.75rem) for mobile horizontal padding
- Normalized section spacing rhythm across all 17 pages
- Verified mobile layout at 320px and 768px viewports (no overflow, consistent padding)
- Verified desktop layout at 1024px and 1920px viewports (balanced, centered)
- Normalized component alignment across all pages (cards, sections, CTAs)

Ask user to verify at 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1920px viewports on representative pages (index, portfolio, exhibit-a, faq, contact). User checks for balanced professional spacing (GitHub/Linear density target), consistent breathing room, card alignment, and no cramped or overly spacious sections.

  <how-to-verify>
**Quick check (2-3 minutes):**

1. Open the site locally and check these representative pages:
   - `index.html` — hero spacing, section rhythm, card grids
   - `portfolio.html` — flagship cards, directory table, stats bar
   - `exhibits/exhibit-a.html` — exhibit content sections, timeline, evidence chains
   - `faq.html` — accordion spacing, hero-minimal
   - `contact.html` — contact methods, social buttons

2. For each page, check at these viewports (use browser DevTools responsive mode):
   - **320px width** (small mobile): Content fits without horizontal scroll, readable spacing, touch-friendly targets
   - **768px width** (tablet): Proper breakpoint behavior, cards may start showing 2 columns
   - **1024px width** (small desktop): Content well-distributed, not cramped
   - **1920px width** (full HD): Content centered, balanced margins, no awkward gaps

3. Verify the overall feel:
   - Is the spacing "balanced and professional" (GitHub/Linear density)?
   - Do sections have consistent breathing room?
   - Are cards visually aligned across pages?
   - Is there any section that feels cramped or overly spacious?

**If issues found:** Describe what looks wrong and on which page/viewport. Example: "Portfolio flagship cards feel too cramped at 320px" or "Too much whitespace between sections on index.html at 1920px".
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if layout looks good, or describe specific issues to fix</resume-signal>

<verification>
User confirms visual quality of layout and spacing changes.

<success_criteria>
- User approves layout at all four viewport sizes
- No visual regressions reported
- Spacing feels balanced and professional per user's stated preference
</success_criteria>
