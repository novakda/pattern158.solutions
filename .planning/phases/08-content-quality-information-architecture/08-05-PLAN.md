<objective>
Align portfolio page with restructured exhibits, apply recommended exhibit ordering, run final grammar quality gate across all 16 pages, and present changes for user verification.

Purpose: Portfolio is the bridge between the homepage hook and deep exhibit content. Its summaries must accurately reflect the restructured exhibits and present them in strength order. The final quality gate ensures zero typos/grammar errors across the entire site.

Output: Updated portfolio.html, verified zero-error grammar results, user-approved content changes.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Align portfolio page with restructured exhibits and run final quality gate</name>
  <files>
    portfolio.html
  </files>
  <action>
    Read portfolio.html current content. Read all 11 restructured exhibit pages (or fewer if any were consolidated in Plan 04). Read ia-analysis.md exhibit ordering recommendation. Read 08-03-SUMMARY.md and 08-04-SUMMARY.md for any consolidation decisions.

    **Portfolio page restructuring:**
    - Model: NTSB "probable cause summaries" — each exhibit gets a high-level overview card that links to the full investigation report
    - Reorder exhibits per ia-analysis.md strength-based ordering recommendation
    - Update each exhibit summary to accurately reflect the restructured content:
      - Use the exhibit's new title ("Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]")
      - Brief summary capturing the investigation story (2-3 sentences)
      - Key outcome/finding (the "probable cause" — what was the core result?)
      - Technologies used (brief list, not exhaustive)
      - Link to full exhibit
    - If any exhibits were consolidated in Plans 03-04, remove the retired exhibit's summary card
    - Authoritative tone consistent with rest of site

    **Impact-first presentation per CONTEXT.md:**
    - Hiring manager can identify key outcomes within 30-second scan
    - Quantifiable results/metrics highlighted in summaries, not buried in prose
    - Each summary card should lead with the impact, not the technology

    **Cross-references:**
    - Ensure portfolio-to-exhibit links are correct (href paths)
    - If Plan 02 modified nav structure, ensure portfolio fits

    **Grammar/typo fixes:**
    - Fix any issues on portfolio.html flagged in grammar-report.txt
    - Authoritative tone, no passive hedging

    **Final quality gate:**
    After portfolio edits, run `npm run audit:grammar` across ALL 16 pages to verify the entire site is clean. Document any remaining findings. For each remaining finding, determine if it's a genuine error (fix it) or a false positive from write-good (document and accept — per research: write-good suggestions are candidates, not mandates).

    **Grammar quality gate acceptance criteria:**
    - All genuine typos/spelling errors: ZERO remaining
    - All genuine grammar errors: ZERO remaining
    - write-good style suggestions (passive voice, adverbs): acceptable if intentional and serves the voice
    - Document any accepted write-good suggestions with reasoning
  </action>
  <verify>
    - portfolio.html renders correctly with all exhibit summary cards
    - Exhibit ordering matches ia-analysis.md recommendation
    - Each summary accurately reflects restructured exhibit content
    - All exhibit links (href) are valid and point to correct files
    - `npm run audit:grammar` output reviewed — zero genuine errors, any accepted suggestions documented
    - No CSS class or ID breakage on portfolio.html
  </verify>
  <done>
    Portfolio page aligned with NTSB probable-cause-summary model. Exhibits ordered by strength. Summaries accurately reflect restructured content. Final grammar gate passed across all 16 pages with zero genuine errors.

    Present all content changes from Plans 02-05 for user review. This checkpoint covers the complete content quality and information architecture overhaul across all 16 public pages:

    **Main pages (Plan 02):**
    - index.html: Trimmed to hook+route model, diagnostician/breadth messaging
    - philosophy.html: Strengthened with authoritative voice, methodology section added
    - technologies.html: Purpose clarified and content restructured
    - faq.html: Fate decided (strengthened/merged/retired per audit)
    - contact.html: Engagement criteria and "not a good fit" anti-patterns added
    - testimonials.html: Professional social proof presentation

    **Exhibits (Plans 03-04):**
    - All 11 exhibits restructured using NTSB investigation model
    - "Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" naming convention applied
    - Technologies woven into narrative + summary lists
    - Cross-references added where valuable
    - Cross-exhibit consistency verified

    **Portfolio (Plan 05):**
    - Reordered by exhibit strength
    - Summaries updated to "probable cause summary" model
    - Impact-first presentation for 30s scan

    **Quality:**
    - ROT audit documented in inventory/rot-audit.csv
    - Grammar quality gate passed (zero genuine errors)

    User reviews all 16 pages in browser:
    1. Open index.html — verify hook is compelling, page is concise (under 2 screens), CTAs route clearly
    2. Open philosophy.html — verify authoritative tone, methodology section present, principles read as filter not pitch
    3. Open contact.html — verify "not a good fit" criteria present, engagement types clear
    4. Open portfolio.html — verify exhibit ordering feels right, summaries capture impact, 30s scan works
    5. Open 2-3 exhibits — verify NTSB structure, technology integration, authoritative voice
    6. Open technologies.html — verify purpose is clear, presentation contextual (not resume-style)
    7. If FAQ was retired, verify its content was distributed appropriately
    8. Spot-check for proprietary content concerns (GP/client details)
