<objective>
Execute editorial pass on all 7 non-exhibit pages: trim redundancy, fix grammar/typos, shift tone to authoritative consultant voice, and optimize information architecture per audit analysis findings.

Purpose: These 7 pages form the site's core navigation shell. Their content must be polished, purposeful, and correctly targeted before exhibit restructuring can align with the overall IA.

Output: 7 edited HTML files with improved content, ROT audit CSV documenting all editorial decisions.

    Read ia-analysis.md recommendations for these three pages. Read each page's current HTML content. Apply editorial changes guided by CONTEXT.md locked decisions and ia-analysis.md recommendations.

    **index.html (Homepage):**
    - Implement "hook and route" model: quick credibility hit then funnel to deeper pages
    - Target: under 2 screens of scroll (user said "minimal scrolling")
    - Blend diagnostician/investigator angle (the hook) with breadth of experience (the proof)
    - Trim content that belongs on deeper pages — move or remove, don't repeat
    - Add clear CTAs routing visitors to philosophy, portfolio, contact
    - User said homepage is "too long" — this is a known weak spot, aggressively trim
    - Tone: authoritative senior consultant voice

    **philosophy.html:**
    - This is a CORE page, central to site identity — preserve and strengthen
    - Shift tone to "senior consultant who's done this 100 times" — authoritative, not conversational
    - Eliminate passive hedging ("I think," "I believe," "sort of," "pretty much")
    - Principles are prime movers, not a sales pitch — they're a filter for the right fit
    - Add explicit methodology section describing forensic/diagnostic approach (placement at Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md — can be on this page or a dedicated page; prefer this page unless content volume justifies separation)
    - Client audience reads fully, others scan — structure for both

    **contact.html:**
    - Clear next steps for action
    - Add "not a good fit" criteria per user decision: anti-pattern is direct employment at billable-hours-first consultancies
    - Add types of engagements open to
    - Cross-reference portfolio/philosophy for capability evidence
    - Keep concise — this is an action page, not an information page

    **For all three pages:**
    - Fix any grammar/typos flagged in grammar-report.txt
    - Eliminate redundant content flagged in duplicate-report.txt (per ROT audit — consolidate to canonical location or justify echo)
    - Exercise caution with former employer (GP) and client proprietary information — flag anything questionable
    - Preserve HTML structure (sections, classes, IDs) that CSS depends on — edit text content, not layout containers
    - Maintain existing design tokens and CSS class references

    **ROT Audit CSV:**
    Create or append to `inventory/rot-audit.csv` with columns: content_piece, current_locations, category (R/O/T), reasoning, decision (keep/remove/consolidate/update), canonical_location, action_taken. Document every editorial decision for these 3 pages.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All three HTML files render correctly in browser (no broken HTML)
    - Run `npm run audit:grammar` and confirm reduced or zero findings on these 3 pages
    - rot-audit.csv exists with documented decisions
    - index.html is noticeably shorter than before (was known too-long)
    - philosophy.html has methodology content
    - contact.html has "not a good fit" criteria
  </verify>
  <done>
    index.html trimmed to hook+route model under 2 screens. philosophy.html strengthened with authoritative tone and methodology section. contact.html has engagement criteria and anti-patterns. All grammar/typo issues fixed. ROT decisions documented.

  <action>
    Read ia-analysis.md recommendations for these three pages. Read each page's current HTML content. Apply editorial changes.

    **technologies.html:**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: audit should determine this page's purpose (skills inventory vs breadth showcase vs something else)
    - Apply the recommendation from ia-analysis.md
    - Technologies should be both woven into narrative AND have a summary list for quick scanning (per exhibit decisions, but applies here too)
    - Engineering peers care about: technical depth woven into problem-solving narratives
    - Don't present as resume-style tech list (anti-pattern from research: "technology lists without context")
    - Curate: Claude's discretion on forward-looking vs comprehensive approach
    - Authoritative tone throughout

    **faq.html:**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: Claude decides FAQ fate — strengthen in place, merge into other pages, or retire based on audit findings
    - Apply the recommendation from ia-analysis.md
    - If strengthening: focus on real objection-handling and logistics, not generic "about me" content
    - If merging: distribute content to appropriate pages (contact for logistics, philosophy for methodology questions)
    - If retiring: ensure no valuable content is lost (distribute first)
    - User said FAQ "feels thin" — this is a known weak spot

    **testimonials.html:**
    - Social proof and field reports from actual engagements
    - Shift to authoritative presentation — these are professional endorsements, not casual quotes
    - User note: testimonials sourced from email archives without explicit permission — flag for later, keep as-is for now (do NOT remove testimonials, just note the concern)
    - Ensure testimonials support the three audience journeys (hiring managers see credibility, engineers see technical respect, clients see satisfaction)

    **For all three pages:**
    - Fix grammar/typos from grammar-report.txt
    - Eliminate redundancy per duplicate-report.txt
    - Authoritative tone shift
    - Preserve HTML structure and CSS class references
    - Exercise caution with proprietary information
    - Append ROT decisions to inventory/rot-audit.csv

    **IMPORTANT: If FAQ is retired (page removed), update this in the SUMMARY so Plan 03/04 know about the change. If FAQ content is merged into other pages that were already edited in Task 1, make those edits here.**

  <verify>
    - All modified HTML files render correctly
    - Run `npm run audit:grammar` and confirm reduced findings on these pages
