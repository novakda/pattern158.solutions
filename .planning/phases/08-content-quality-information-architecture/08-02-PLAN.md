<objective>
Execute editorial pass on all 7 non-exhibit pages: trim redundancy, fix grammar/typos, shift tone to authoritative consultant voice, and optimize information architecture per audit analysis findings.

Purpose: These 7 pages form the site's core navigation shell. Their content must be polished, purposeful, and correctly targeted before exhibit restructuring can align with the overall IA.

Output: 7 edited HTML files with improved content, ROT audit CSV documenting all editorial decisions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Decide FAQ fate and editorial pass on faq.html, technologies.html, testimonials.html</name>
  <files>
    faq.html
    technologies.html
    testimonials.html
    .planning/phases/08-content-quality-information-architecture/inventory/rot-audit.csv
  </files>
  <action>
    Read ia-analysis.md recommendations for these three pages. Read each page's current HTML content. Apply editorial changes.

    **CRITICAL — FAQ fate must be decided FIRST in this task, before any other edits.** This determines whether FAQ content needs to be distributed to other pages (index, philosophy, contact) which are edited in Task 2. Record the FAQ decision and any content designated for other pages so Task 2 can incorporate it.

    **faq.html (DECIDE FIRST):**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: Claude decides FAQ fate — strengthen in place, merge into other pages, or retire based on audit findings
    - Apply the recommendation from ia-analysis.md
    - If strengthening: focus on real objection-handling and logistics, not generic "about me" content
    - If merging: distribute content to appropriate pages (contact for logistics, philosophy for methodology questions) — document exactly which content goes where so Task 2 can incorporate it
    - If retiring: ensure no valuable content is lost (distribute first) — document content distribution plan
    - User said FAQ "feels thin" — this is a known weak spot
    - **Output:** Document FAQ decision and any content redistribution targets in rot-audit.csv and leave notes for Task 2 in the SUMMARY

    **technologies.html:**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: audit should determine this page's purpose (skills inventory vs breadth showcase vs something else)
    - Apply the recommendation from ia-analysis.md
    - Technologies should be both woven into narrative AND have a summary list for quick scanning (per exhibit decisions, but applies here too)
    - Engineering peers care about: technical depth woven into problem-solving narratives
    - Don't present as resume-style tech list (anti-pattern from research: "technology lists without context")
    - Curate: Claude's discretion on forward-looking vs comprehensive approach
    - Authoritative tone throughout

    **testimonials.html:**
    - Social proof and field reports from actual engagements
    - Shift to authoritative presentation — these are professional endorsements, not casual quotes
    - User note: testimonials sourced from email archives without explicit permission — flag for later, keep as-is for now (do NOT remove testimonials, just note the concern)
    - Ensure testimonials support the three audience journeys (hiring managers see credibility, engineers see technical respect, clients see satisfaction)

    **For all three pages:**
    - Fix grammar/typos from grammar-report.txt
    - Eliminate redundancy per duplicate-report.txt
    - Authoritative tone shift
    - Preserve HTML structure and CSS class references
    - Exercise caution with proprietary information

    **ROT Audit CSV:**
    Create `inventory/rot-audit.csv` with columns: content_piece, current_locations, category (R/O/T), reasoning, decision (keep/remove/consolidate/update), canonical_location, action_taken. Document every editorial decision for these 3 pages. Include FAQ redistribution plan if applicable.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All modified HTML files render correctly
    - Run `npm run audit:grammar` and confirm reduced findings on these pages
    - technologies.html has clear purpose and contextual technology presentation
    - FAQ decision implemented (strengthened, merged, or retired) and documented
    - If FAQ merged/retired: redistribution targets clearly documented in rot-audit.csv
    - testimonials.html presents endorsements professionally
    - rot-audit.csv exists with documented decisions for these 3 pages
  </verify>
  <done>
    FAQ fate decided and implemented (with redistribution targets documented if applicable). technologies.html serves clear determined purpose with contextual tech presentation. testimonials.html polished for professional social proof. All grammar issues fixed. ROT decisions documented.
  </done>

  <files>
    index.html
    philosophy.html
    contact.html
  </files>
  <action>
    Read ia-analysis.md recommendations for these three pages. Read each page's current HTML content. Apply editorial changes guided by CONTEXT.md locked decisions and ia-analysis.md recommendations.

    **IMPORTANT: Check rot-audit.csv from Task 1 for any FAQ content designated for redistribution to these pages. If FAQ was merged or retired, incorporate the relevant content into the appropriate pages during this edit pass.**

    **index.html (Homepage):**
    - Implement "hook and route" model: quick credibility hit then funnel to deeper pages
    - Target: under 2 screens of scroll (user said "minimal scrolling")
    - Blend diagnostician/investigator angle (the hook) with breadth of experience (the proof)
    - Trim content that belongs on deeper pages — move or remove, don't repeat
    - Add clear CTAs routing visitors to philosophy, portfolio, contact
    - User said homepage is "too long" — this is a known weak spot, aggressively trim
    - Tone: authoritative senior consultant voice
    - If FAQ content was marked for redistribution here, integrate naturally

    **philosophy.html:**
    - This is a CORE page, central to site identity — preserve and strengthen
    - Shift tone to "senior consultant who's done this 100 times" — authoritative, not conversational
    - Eliminate passive hedging ("I think," "I believe," "sort of," "pretty much")
    - Principles are prime movers, not a sales pitch — they're a filter for the right fit
    - Add explicit methodology section describing forensic/diagnostic approach (placement at Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md — can be on this page or a dedicated page; prefer this page unless content volume justifies separation)
    - Client audience reads fully, others scan — structure for both
    - If FAQ methodology-related content was marked for redistribution here, integrate into methodology section

    **contact.html:**
    - Clear next steps for action
    - Add "not a good fit" criteria per user decision: anti-pattern is direct employment at billable-hours-first consultancies
    - Add types of engagements open to
    - Cross-reference portfolio/philosophy for capability evidence
    - Keep concise — this is an action page, not an information page
    - If FAQ logistics content was marked for redistribution here, integrate naturally

    **For all three pages:**
    - Fix any grammar/typos flagged in grammar-report.txt
    - Eliminate redundant content flagged in duplicate-report.txt (per ROT audit — consolidate to canonical location or justify echo)
    - Exercise caution with former employer (GP) and client proprietary information — flag anything questionable
    - Preserve HTML structure (sections, classes, IDs) that CSS depends on — edit text content, not layout containers
    - Maintain existing design tokens and CSS class references
    - Append ROT decisions to inventory/rot-audit.csv

    **If FAQ was retired (page removed), note this in the SUMMARY so Plans 03-05 know about the change.**
