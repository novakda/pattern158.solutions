<objective>
Restructure exhibits A through F (5 pages) using the NTSB investigation report model with per-exhibit structure variants. Apply authoritative tone, technology integration, and content quality improvements.

Purpose: Exhibits are the site's deepest content — "full investigation reports" that demonstrate technical depth and problem-solving methodology. Splitting the 11 exhibits across two plans (03 and 04) ensures consistent quality without context degradation.

Output: 5 restructured exhibit HTML files following consistent investigation-style patterns.

  <name>Task 1: Restructure exhibits A through F</name>
  <files>

  <action>
    Read ia-analysis.md exhibit assessments for exhibits A-F. Read each exhibit's current HTML content. Read the Obsidian vault source material for additional context if needed: `/mnt/c/main/Obsidian Vault/CAREER/EmailArchive/Projects/`

    For each exhibit, apply the following editorial framework:

    **Structure per CONTEXT.md decisions:**
    - Use NTSB investigation report as structural model
    - Claude decides per exhibit: standard structure (Challenge/Approach/Solution/Results) OR investigation-inspired variant (Situation/Investigation/Analysis/Findings/Impact) — choose whichever better serves the story
    - Some exhibits are discovery-heavy, long-running, or lack clean results — adapt structure accordingly
    - Apply ia-analysis.md recommended structure variant for each exhibit

    **Naming convention:**
    - Title format: "Exhibit [Letter]: [Descriptive Subtitle]"
    - Example: "Exhibit A: The Accessibility Practice"

    **Exhibit A special treatment (per CONTEXT.md):**
    - Show full arc: had no training -> built technical methodology -> became organizational standard
    - This is both a practice-building AND technical story
    - Should be one of the strongest exhibits — give it appropriate depth

    **Content requirements for ALL exhibits:**
    - Technologies: weave into narrative AND provide a summary list/section for quick scanning
    - Results evidence: use whatever exists — adoption rates, qualitative quotes, before/after comparisons — be honest when hard metrics aren't available
    - Length varies by project — stronger stories get more space, no fixed target per CONTEXT.md
    - Claude decides depth per exhibit based on how interesting the investigation story is
    - "Lessons learned" section only where meaningful — skip when forced
    - Simple diagrams where they help clarify the story (HTML/CSS-only diagrams, no images needed — use styled divs/SVG for flow charts or architecture diagrams)

    **Tone and style:**
    - Authoritative senior consultant voice throughout
    - Eliminate passive hedging
    - Show the thinking AND the tech chops together (per engineering peer audience needs)
    - Artisan positioning: quality of work, honest about capabilities and limits

    **Cross-references:**
    - Claude decides where cross-references between exhibits add value vs create clutter
    - Only add cross-references when there's a genuine narrative connection (shared technology, related challenge, sequential relationship)

    **Proprietary content caution:**
    - Exercise caution with former employer (GP) and client proprietary information
    - Flag anything that might reveal proprietary details for user review in SUMMARY

    **HTML preservation:**
    - Maintain existing section structure, CSS classes, and IDs that the stylesheet depends on
    - Can add new sections/classes but don't remove existing structural containers
    - Keep all design token references in inline styles

    - All 5 exhibit HTML files render correctly without broken HTML
    - Each exhibit has a recognizable investigation-style structure
    - Each exhibit title follows "Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" format
    - Exhibit A shows the full accessibility arc narrative
    - Technologies appear both in narrative and in a summary section
    - No CSS class or ID breakage
