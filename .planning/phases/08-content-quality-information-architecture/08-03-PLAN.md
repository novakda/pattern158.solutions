<objective>
Restructure all 12 exhibit pages using the NTSB investigation report model with per-exhibit structure variants. Apply authoritative tone, technology integration, and content quality improvements.

Purpose: Exhibits are the site's deepest content — "full investigation reports" that demonstrate technical depth and problem-solving methodology. They must tell compelling stories that serve all three audiences: hiring managers scanning for impact, engineers evaluating technical depth, and clients assessing capability.

Output: 12 restructured exhibit HTML files following consistent investigation-style patterns.

  <action>
    Read ia-analysis.md exhibit assessments for exhibits A-F. Read each exhibit's current HTML content. Read the Obsidian vault source material for additional context if needed: `/mnt/c/main/Obsidian Vault/CAREER/EmailArchive/Projects/`

    For each exhibit, apply the following editorial framework:

    **Structure per CONTEXT.md decisions:**
    - Use NTSB investigation report as structural model
    - Claude decides per exhibit: standard structure (Challenge/Approach/Solution/Results) OR investigation-inspired variant (Situation/Investigation/Analysis/Findings/Impact) — choose whichever better serves the story
    - Some exhibits are discovery-heavy, long-running, or lack clean results — adapt structure accordingly
    - Apply ia-analysis.md recommended structure variant for each exhibit

    **Naming convention:**
    - Title format: "Exhibit [Letter]: [Descriptive Subtitle]"
    - Example: "Exhibit A: The Accessibility Practice"

    **Exhibit A special treatment (per CONTEXT.md):**
    - Show full arc: had no training -> built technical methodology -> became organizational standard
    - This is both a practice-building AND technical story
    - Should be one of the strongest exhibits — give it appropriate depth

    **Content requirements for ALL exhibits:**
    - Technologies: weave into narrative AND provide a summary list/section for quick scanning
    - Results evidence: use whatever exists — adoption rates, qualitative quotes, before/after comparisons — be honest when hard metrics aren't available
    - Length varies by project — stronger stories get more space, no fixed target per CONTEXT.md
    - Claude decides depth per exhibit based on how interesting the investigation story is
    - "Lessons learned" section only where meaningful — skip when forced
    - Simple diagrams where they help clarify the story (HTML/CSS-only diagrams, no images needed — use styled divs/SVG for flow charts or architecture diagrams)

    **Tone and style:**
    - Authoritative senior consultant voice throughout
    - Eliminate passive hedging
    - Show the thinking AND the tech chops together (per engineering peer audience needs)
    - Artisan positioning: quality of work, honest about capabilities and limits

    **Cross-references:**
    - Claude decides where cross-references between exhibits add value vs create clutter
    - Only add cross-references when there's a genuine narrative connection (shared technology, related challenge, sequential relationship)

    **Proprietary content caution:**
    - Exercise caution with former employer (GP) and client proprietary information
    - Flag anything that might reveal proprietary details for user review in SUMMARY

    **HTML preservation:**
    - Maintain existing section structure, CSS classes, and IDs that the stylesheet depends on
    - Can add new sections/classes but don't remove existing structural containers
    - Keep all design token references in inline styles
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All 5 exhibit HTML files render correctly without broken HTML
    - Each exhibit has a recognizable investigation-style structure
    - Each exhibit title follows "Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" format
    - Exhibit A shows the full accessibility arc narrative
    - Technologies appear both in narrative and in a summary section
    - No CSS class or ID breakage
  </verify>
  <done>
    Exhibits A, B, C, D, F restructured using NTSB investigation model with per-exhibit structure variants. Authoritative tone applied. Technology integration complete. Cross-references added where valuable.

    Read ia-analysis.md exhibit assessments for exhibits G-L. Read each exhibit's current HTML content. Read the Obsidian vault source material for additional context if needed.

    Apply the same editorial framework as Task 1:

    **For each exhibit:**
    - Choose structure variant (standard or investigation-inspired) based on story fit
    - Apply "Exhibit [Letter]: [Subtitle]" naming
    - Weave technologies into narrative + summary list
    - Use honest results evidence (whatever exists)
    - Depth proportional to story strength
    - Authoritative tone, no passive hedging
    - Cross-references only where genuinely valuable
    - Lessons learned only where meaningful
    - Simple diagrams where they clarify
    - Caution with proprietary information

    **Exhibit consolidation assessment:**
    - Per CONTEXT.md: audit should assess whether any of the 12 exhibits could be stronger combined
    - If ia-analysis.md recommended any consolidations, implement them here (combine the weaker exhibit's content into the stronger one, remove the weaker page)
    - If consolidating: ensure no internal links break, note in SUMMARY which exhibits were consolidated

    **Consistency check across ALL 12 exhibits:**
    - After completing G-L, do a quick consistency scan across all 12:
      - Consistent heading hierarchy usage
      - Consistent technology summary section placement
      - Consistent tone (no exhibit should feel markedly different in voice)
      - Cross-references are reciprocal where appropriate

    **HTML preservation:** Same rules as Task 1 — maintain structural CSS hooks.

    - All 6 exhibit HTML files render correctly
    - Each exhibit has investigation-style structure
    - Each exhibit title follows naming convention
    - Technology summary sections present in all exhibits
    - Consistency across all 12 exhibits (spot-check heading patterns)
    - Any consolidation decisions documented
    - No CSS class or ID breakage
  </verify>
  <done>
    Exhibits G, H, I, J, K, L restructured. All 12 exhibits now follow consistent NTSB investigation model with appropriate per-exhibit variants. Cross-exhibit consistency verified. Any consolidation recommendations implemented.
