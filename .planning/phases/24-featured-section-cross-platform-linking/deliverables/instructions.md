# LinkedIn Featured Section — Application Instructions

## Overview

Step-by-step instructions for adding Featured items to LinkedIn profile using copy variants from featured-copy.md. Featured section is high-value profile real estate that appears above Experience on mobile (60% of LinkedIn traffic), making it critical for first-impression engagement.

These instructions combine Featured section setup with Phase 23 profile updates (headline, about, custom URL, email) to provide a complete LinkedIn optimization checklist.

## OG Image Thumbnail Note

**Current status:** HTML meta tags updated to 1200x627 dimensions (Plan 02 Task 1 complete). Actual image file (pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png) still at 1024x559 dimensions.

**What you'll see initially:**
- Featured thumbnails may display old cached OG data (1024x559 dimensions)
- Thumbnails may appear slightly stretched or letterboxed
- This is normal — LinkedIn caches OG data for 24-48 hours

**To get optimal thumbnails:**
1. **Resize the image file:**
   - Open /assets/images/logos/pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png in image editor
   - Resize/recompose from 1024x559 to 1200x627 (see og-image-strategy.md for aspect ratio handling)
   - Save file (can replace existing or save as _1200x627.png variant)

2. **Refresh LinkedIn's OG cache:**
   - **Method 1:** Create new LinkedIn post, paste exhibit URL (LinkedIn re-scrapes), close without publishing
   - **Method 2:** Wait 24-48 hours for LinkedIn cache to naturally expire
   - **Method 3:** Use LinkedIn Post Inspector if available (force re-scrape)

3. **Verify thumbnails:**
   - Check Featured section after cache refresh
   - Thumbnails should display at 1200x627 resolution without distortion
   - Logo should be crisp and legible at thumbnail scale

**Timeline:**
- HTML ready: ✅ Complete (Plan 02 Task 1)
- Image resize: ⏳ User/designer work (outside GSD scope)
- Cache refresh: ⏳ 24-48 hours after image resize
- Optimal display: ⏳ After cache refresh complete

## Troubleshooting

### Featured Section Not Visible
**Issue:** Can't find Featured section on profile
**Solution:** Click "Add profile section" → "Recommended" → "Add featured" → Featured section will appear after adding first item

### Thumbnails Don't Update
**Issue:** Featured items still show old/incorrect thumbnails after image resize
**Solution:** LinkedIn caches OG data. Try:
1. Paste URL in LinkedIn share dialog to trigger re-scrape (don't publish)
2. Wait 24-48 hours for cache expiration
3. Check if HTML meta tags correctly updated (grep for 1200 and 627 in HTML files)

### Titles Revert to Defaults
**Issue:** Custom titles/descriptions disappear, showing site's default OG text instead
**Solution:**
1. Edit the Featured item again
2. Re-enter custom title and description
3. Save
4. LinkedIn sometimes overrides custom copy — may need to re-apply periodically

### GitHub Social Link Not Showing
**Issue:** Added LinkedIn to GitHub profile but icon doesn't appear
**Solution:**
1. Verify URL format is correct: https://linkedin.com/in/[your-url]
2. Check if it appears in "Social accounts" section of GitHub Settings → Profile
3. GitHub may take a few minutes to update profile display
4. Refresh browser cache (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Featured Items Don't Reorder
**Issue:** Drag-and-drop reordering not working
**Solution:**
1. Enter Featured section edit mode (click pencil icon)
2. Look for three horizontal lines (drag handle) next to each item
3. Click and hold drag handle, then drag up/down
4. If drag handles not visible, try on desktop browser (mobile may not support reordering)

## Copy Variant Selection Guide

Featured items have 3 copy variants each (15 total options). Choose based on your target audience and tone preference:

### Outcome-Focused Variants
**Best for:** Hiring managers, recruiters, results-oriented decision makers
**Tone:** Direct, impact-driven, "what it achieved"
**Example:** "How I Cut QA Testing From Hours to Minutes"
**Use when:** Emphasizing measurable results and business value

### Curiosity-Driven Variants
**Best for:** Engineers, technical peers, culture-fit evaluation
**Tone:** Storytelling, intrigue, "why it matters"
**Example:** "The Tool I Built Because Testing Courses Broke My Brain"
**Use when:** Creating engagement through relatable pain points and narrative hooks

### Technical Showcase Variants
**Best for:** Technical interviewers, senior engineers, architects
**Tone:** Methodology-focused, engineering depth, "how it works"
**Example:** "TASBot for eLearning: Vue.js Debugger with Save States"
**Use when:** Demonstrating technical competency and architectural thinking

**Recommendation:** Mix and match across Featured items. Use outcome-focused for GM Investigation (strongest proof point), curiosity-driven for SCORM Debugger (relatable pain point), technical for MCAPS (demonstrates modern AI architecture). This creates variety and appeals to multiple audience types scanning the Featured section.
