# LinkedIn Featured Section — Exhibit Selection & Copy

## Selection Criteria

Five items selected to balance brand recognition (GM Investigation, Electric Boat), story impact (forensic methodology, first-to-market innovation), skill diversity (forensic investigation, automation tooling, AI/modern platforms, cross-domain frameworks, enterprise scale), and hiring manager appeal (senior engineering competencies). All links route through pattern158.solutions as brand hub.

Quality over quantity: Five strong items that showcase different engineering dimensions rather than filling all six slots with filler content. Each represents a distinct technical competency area relevant to senior full-stack engineering roles.
