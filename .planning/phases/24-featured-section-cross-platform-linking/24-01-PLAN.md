<objective>
Select 4-5 pattern158.solutions exhibits for LinkedIn Featured section and write 2-3 LinkedIn-specific copy variants per item. Document OG image strategy decision.

Purpose: LinkedIn Featured section is high-value profile real estate (above Experience on mobile, 60% of LinkedIn traffic). Custom copy optimized for click-through creates engagement that default OG text cannot. Multiple variants give the user choice over tone and framing.

Output: featured-copy.md (exhibit selection + copy variants), og-image-strategy.md (image dimension strategy)

  <name>Task 1: Select Featured exhibits and write LinkedIn-specific copy variants</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-featured-section-cross-platform-linking/deliverables/featured-copy.md</files>
  <action>
Create deliverables/featured-copy.md with Featured exhibit selection and copy variants.

**Exhibit Selection (4-5 items):**

Read ALL 14 exhibit HTML files (exhibits/exhibit-a.html through exhibit-n.html) plus index.html and philosophy.html to understand available content. Select 4-5 items that balance:
- Brand recognition (flagship projects that establish professional identity)
- Story impact (exhibits with compelling narrative or surprising outcomes)
- Skill diversity (different technical dimensions: forensic investigation, automation tooling, AI/modern platforms, eLearning domain, enterprise scale)
- Audience appeal (hiring managers evaluating senior engineering talent)

CONTEXT.md success criteria mentions GM Investigation, SCORM Debugger, homepage, philosophy as examples — interpret these as strong candidates, not hard requirements. All Featured links must go to pattern158.solutions URLs (no direct GitHub links). Quality over quantity: 4-5 strong items preferred over filling all 6 slots.

For each selected exhibit, document:
- URL (pattern158.solutions path)
- Why selected (which dimension it covers)
- Current OG title and description (for reference, NOT for reuse)

**Copy Variants (2-3 per item):**

For each selected exhibit, write 2-3 copy variants with:
- **Title**: 35-50 characters, outcome-focused or curiosity-driven (NOT documentation-style). LinkedIn Featured titles should make viewers want to click.
- **Description**: 80-120 characters, what the viewer will learn/gain, CTA-style ending. Create curiosity gap — promise insight, not just information.

Three variant approaches to consider for each item:
1. **Outcome-focused**: What it achieved/solved ("How I Cut QA Testing From Hours to Minutes")
2. **Curiosity-driven**: What makes it interesting ("The Tool I Built Because Manual Testing Broke My Brain")
3. **Technical showcase**: Engineering methodology angle ("Forensic Engineering: Tracing a 4x Spike to Root Cause")

Copy must be LinkedIn-specific — different from site OG tags. Featured viewers are evaluating whether to engage further. Speak to their decision context.

Write copy that coheres with the Phase 23 About section voice (first-person, proof-point-driven, engineering-first positioning). Reference the about.md deliverable for tone calibration.

**Ordering Recommendation:**

Recommend Featured item ordering with rationale. Default to strength-first (most compelling item first) since LinkedIn Featured viewers scan quickly. Document why the recommended order works.

**Document structure:**
```
# LinkedIn Featured Section — Exhibit Selection & Copy

## Selection Criteria
[Brief rationale for selection approach]

## Featured Item 1: [Exhibit Name]
**URL:** https://pattern158.solutions/...
**Why selected:** [dimension coverage]
**Current OG title:** [for reference]
**Current OG description:** [for reference]

### Variant 1: [Approach name]
**Title:** [35-50 chars]
**Description:** [80-120 chars]

### Variant 2: [Approach name]
**Title:** [35-50 chars]
**Description:** [80-120 chars]

### Variant 3: [Approach name]
**Title:** [35-50 chars]
**Description:** [80-120 chars]

[Repeat for each selected item]

  <name>Task 2: Document OG image strategy decision</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/24-featured-section-cross-platform-linking/deliverables/og-image-strategy.md</files>
  <action>
Create deliverables/og-image-strategy.md documenting the OG image approach decision.

**Current state:**
- All pages use same image: pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png (1024x559, 16KB)
- Current aspect ratio: 1.83:1
- LinkedIn recommended: 1200x627 (1.91:1 ratio)
- Aspect ratio difference means simple resize will crop or distort

**Decision document structure:**

1. **Current state analysis**: Document current image, dimensions, aspect ratio, file size
2. **Option A: Consistent branding** (same logo on all pages, resized to 1200x627)
   - Pros: Brand consistency, simpler execution, faster to implement
   - Cons: All Featured items look identical in thumbnails, no visual differentiation
   - Implementation: Resize/recompose logo from 1024x559 to 1200x627, update all HTML meta tags
3. **Option B: Unique per-exhibit images** (different image per exhibit, all at 1200x627)
   - Pros: Visual differentiation in Featured section, each item has distinct thumbnail
   - Cons: Need to create/source 14+ images, more complex maintenance
   - Implementation: Design or screenshot-based images for each featured exhibit
4. **Recommendation**: Make a clear recommendation with rationale (CONTEXT.md gives Claude discretion here)
5. **Implementation plan**: What needs to happen in Plan 02 regardless of option chosen (dimension updates to HTML meta tags are needed either way)
6. **Aspect ratio handling**: Document that 1024x559 (1.83:1) to 1200x627 (1.91:1) requires recomposition, not just resize. Options: add padding/margins, crop strategically, or design new composition at target dimensions.

Note: The actual image file creation/resize is outside scope of this plan (requires image editing tools). This document captures the DECISION so Plan 02 can implement the HTML meta tag changes and the user can create/resize image files separately.
