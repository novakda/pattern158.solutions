<objective>
Update OG image dimensions across all HTML files, fix footer GitHub links (xhiris -> novakda), create cross-platform link map, and write LinkedIn Featured section application instructions.

Purpose: OG image dimensions must match LinkedIn recommended spec (1200x627) for proper thumbnail rendering. Footer GitHub links currently point to wrong account (xhiris instead of primary novakda). Cross-platform link map documents and verifies the bidirectional link loop. Instructions enable user to add Featured items to LinkedIn profile.

Output: Updated HTML files (23 pages), cross-platform-links.md, instructions.md

**OG Image Dimension Updates (all 23 HTML pages):**

Update og:image:width and og:image:height meta tags on every HTML page from current 1024x559 to 1200x627:

Replace across all pages:
```html
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1024">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="559">
```
With:
```html
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="627">
```

Pages to update (9 root + 14 exhibits = 23 total):
- Root: index.html, philosophy.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, faq.html, accessibility.html, testimonials.html, technologies.html, review.html
- Exhibits: exhibit-a.html through exhibit-n.html

Note: The og:image URL itself (pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png) stays the same for now. The actual image file resize is a separate manual task per the OG image strategy document. Updating the meta tag dimensions now prepares for the resized image.

If the og-image-strategy.md recommends a new filename (e.g., pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed_1200x627.png), update the og:image content URL accordingly. Otherwise keep the existing filename — the user will resize the existing file in place.

**Footer GitHub Link Fix (all pages with xhiris links):**

All footer links currently reference github.com/xhiris. The primary GitHub account is github.com/novakda (confirmed in CONTEXT.md). Update ALL footer GitHub links:

Replace:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/xhiris" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
```
With:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/novakda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
```

Affected pages (from grep results — 18 files have github.com/xhiris or github.com/novakda):
- All 14 exhibits (footer links reference xhiris)
- portfolio.html, testimonials.html, technologies.html (footer links reference xhiris)
- contact.html already references novakda (contact page link — verify and leave as-is)

After updates, verify:
- Zero instances of "github.com/xhiris" remain in any HTML file
- All GitHub links point to github.com/novakda
  </action>
  <verify>
Run grep for "1024" and "559" in og:image meta tags across all HTML — should return zero matches. Run grep for "1200" and "627" — should match all 23 pages. Run grep for "github.com/xhiris" — should return zero matches. Run grep for "github.com/novakda" — should match all pages with GitHub footer links.
  </verify>
  <done>All 23 HTML pages have OG image dimensions updated to 1200x627. All footer GitHub links point to github.com/novakda with zero xhiris references remaining.</done>

**Cross-Platform Link Map (cross-platform-links.md):**

Create a comprehensive document mapping every link in the cross-platform loop with verification status. Reference the RESEARCH.md link map pattern.

Document structure:
```
# Cross-Platform Link Map

## Hub: pattern158.solutions

### Outbound Links (site → external)
- [status] LinkedIn profile: URL (location: footer, contact page)
- [status] GitHub profile: URL (location: footer, contact page)

### Inbound Links (external → site)
- [status] LinkedIn Featured section: 4-5 exhibit links (from featured-copy.md)
- [status] LinkedIn About section: pattern158.solutions mention
- [status] GitHub (novakda) profile: needs LinkedIn link added
- [status] GitHub (novakda) README: optional link

## Link Loop Verification
LinkedIn → pattern158.solutions → GitHub (novakda) → LinkedIn

### Step-by-step verification:
1. [ ] LinkedIn Featured → pattern158.solutions exhibits (user adds after Plan 01 copy)
2. [ ] LinkedIn About → pattern158.solutions (exists from Phase 23)
3. [ ] pattern158.solutions footer → LinkedIn (verify link works)
4. [ ] pattern158.solutions footer → GitHub novakda (updated in Task 1)
5. [ ] pattern158.solutions contact → GitHub novakda (already correct)
6. [ ] GitHub novakda profile → LinkedIn (user must add in GitHub settings)
7. [ ] GitHub novakda profile → pattern158.solutions (user adds in GitHub settings or README)

## Current Issues Resolved
- Footer GitHub links updated from xhiris to novakda (Task 1)
- OG image dimensions updated to 1200x627 (Task 1)

## Outstanding Manual Actions
- GitHub novakda profile needs LinkedIn link added (GitHub Settings → Profile → Social accounts)
- GitHub novakda profile optionally add pattern158.solutions link (GitHub Settings → Profile → Website)
- User must add Featured items in LinkedIn UI (see instructions.md)
- OG image file needs resize from 1024x559 to 1200x627 (manual image editing)
```

Include the specific exhibit URLs selected in Plan 01's featured-copy.md for the LinkedIn Featured entries.

**LinkedIn Featured Application Instructions (instructions.md):**

Create step-by-step instructions for adding Featured items to LinkedIn profile. Reference the featured-copy.md deliverable for copy content.

Document structure:
```
# LinkedIn Featured Section — Application Instructions

## Overview
Instructions for adding Featured items to LinkedIn profile using copy from featured-copy.md.

## Pre-Flight Checks
1. Verify Phase 23 changes applied (headline, about, URL, email)
2. Have featured-copy.md open for copy-pasting titles and descriptions

## Adding Featured Items

### Step 1: Navigate to Featured Section
- Go to your LinkedIn profile
- Click "Add profile section" or find the Featured section
- Select "Add a link"

### Step 2: Add Each Featured Link
For each item (in recommended order from featured-copy.md):

1. **[Exhibit Name]**
   - Paste URL: [URL]
   - Wait for preview to load
   - Edit title: [paste from chosen variant]
   - Edit description: [paste from chosen variant]
   - Save

[Repeat for each featured item]

### Step 3: Verify Ordering
- Featured items display in the order added
- To reorder: use drag handles in edit mode
- Recommended order: [from featured-copy.md]

## Post-Flight Verification
1. [ ] All Featured items display correctly
2. [ ] OG thumbnails render (may show old cached image until cache refreshes)
3. [ ] Custom titles and descriptions appear (not default OG text)
4. [ ] Featured section visible above Experience on mobile
5. [ ] All links click through to correct pattern158.solutions pages

## GitHub Profile Link Setup
1. Go to github.com/novakda → Settings → Profile
2. Add LinkedIn URL to Social accounts: https://linkedin.com/in/[your-url]
3. Optionally add website: https://pattern158.solutions
4. Save changes

## OG Image Note
OG image dimensions in HTML updated to 1200x627. Actual image file still at 1024x559.
User needs to resize pattern158_logo_3pipes_detailed.png to 1200x627 before thumbnails display at optimal resolution.
LinkedIn may cache old OG data — use LinkedIn Post Inspector or wait 24-48 hours for cache refresh.

## Troubleshooting
- If thumbnails don't update: LinkedIn caches OG data. Try pasting URL in a new LinkedIn post (don't publish) to trigger re-scrape.
- If titles revert to defaults: Edit the Featured item and re-enter custom title/description.
- If Featured section not visible: May need to add at least one item before section appears on profile.
