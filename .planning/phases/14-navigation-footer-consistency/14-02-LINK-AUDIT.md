- No broken footer links

✅ **Anchor links work correctly:**
- Skip to content (`#main-content`) exists on all pages
- No broken same-page anchors
- No broken cross-page anchors

## Audit Methodology

**Script approach:**
1. Loaded all `id` attributes from all 21 pages into memory
2. Crawled every `href` attribute (navigation, links, resources)
3. Crawled every `src` attribute (images, scripts)
4. Categorized each link and validated:
   - Internal links: Resolved relative paths, verified file exists
   - Anchor links: Verified target `id` exists in target page
   - External links: Validated URL format
   - Resources: Verified file exists on disk
5. Flagged any broken links as BROKEN
6. Flagged any unusual patterns as WARNINGS
7. Counted all valid links by category

**Zero fixes required:** No broken links were found.

## Conclusion

All 687 links across 21 site pages are functional and properly formatted. The navigation and footer changes from Phase 14 Plan 01 did not introduce any broken links, and no pre-existing broken links were detected.

**Site link health: 100%**
