# Phase 19: Profile Foundation & Brand Voice - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish GitHub profile identity aligned with Pattern 158 brand. Update GitHub bio, profile fields, and create a profile README (novakda/novakda repo) that extends the professional identity from pattern158.solutions to GitHub. Repository metadata, fork curation, and pinning are separate phases (20-22).

## Implementation Decisions

### Bio wording
- Lead with domain experience: "28 years" framing with eLearning specificity
- Blend domain outcome with key tech mentions (SCORM/xAPI + accessible systems)
- Include tagline "I cheat, but I cheat fair" in the bio text
- Signal availability — "Open to opportunities" or on-brand equivalent in bio
- No buzzwords: avoid "passionate", "innovative", "thought leader"
- Location field: "Remote"
- Pronouns: he/him
- Accessibility/WCAG mention: Claude's discretion based on 160-char budget
- Pattern 158 name in bio: Claude's discretion based on character budget
- Website mention in bio text vs URL field only: Claude's discretion
- Company field: Claude's discretion (Pattern 158 Solutions vs blank)
- Display name: Claude checks current and recommends
- Availability tone: Claude's discretion — fit it to the overall brand voice

### README structure
- Length: Detailed — full professional profile, not a business card
- Sections: Intro + philosophy, Skills/domains, Featured projects, Contact + links
- Availability signal: Both bio and README (placement within README is Claude's discretion)
- Skills/domains presentation style: Claude's discretion
- novakda/novakda repo: Create new, start private, flip to public when finalized
- Brand elements depth: Claude's discretion (how many of the six to include)
- Three-step methodology inclusion: Claude's discretion
- Cross-linking to website exhibits: Claude's discretion on specific vs homepage
- Pattern 158 name origin (Myst): Claude's discretion
- Featured project card style: Claude's discretion (NTSB FINDING style vs simplified for GitHub markdown)

### Brand intensity
- Tone: Match website voice but slightly warmer for GitHub's community-oriented audience
- NTSB aesthetic level: Claude's discretion — balance brand consistency with GitHub conventions
- Tagline: Include with full attribution — "I cheat, but I cheat fair" — Moe Howard, 1938
- Emoji policy: Claude's discretion (requirements say "no emoji overload")
- Visual formatting (blockquotes, rules, monospace): Claude's discretion
- Color/visual scheme (badges etc.): Claude's discretion
- AI/Claude acknowledgment: Include — fits "cheat fair" philosophy; prominence level is Claude's discretion
- Core impression sequence: Competence ("solves hard problems") → Distinction ("this person is different") → Value ("I should hire this person")

### Project showcase
- Feature career exhibits from pattern158.solutions (case studies), NOT GitHub repos
- Number of exhibits to feature: Claude's discretion
- Description angle: Developer-oriented — emphasize technical challenges and solutions
- Portfolio site as a featured project: Claude's discretion
- Exhibit selection: Claude selects strongest pieces for GitHub developer audience

### Claude's Discretion
- Bio character budget allocation (many elements competing for 160 chars)
- README visual formatting and markdown styling
- NTSB language intensity on GitHub
- Skills section format (grouped, flat, narrative)
- Number and selection of featured exhibits
- AI/Claude mention prominence
- Emoji usage within "no overload" constraint
- Pattern 158 name origin inclusion
- Three-step methodology inclusion
- Exact availability signal phrasing and placement

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- User wants the impression sequence to build: competence → distinction → hirability
- Three Stooges tagline gets full attribution (Moe Howard, 1938) — not just the quote
- AI assistance acknowledgment aligns with "cheat fair" philosophy — transparency is on-brand
- Tone should be slightly warmer than website — GitHub is more community-oriented
- Developer-angle descriptions for featured projects — speak to engineers, not just recruiters
- Bio leads with domain experience (28 years + eLearning/SCORM/xAPI), not generic title
- Availability signal appears in both bio and README
- Repo created private first, flipped public when content is finalized
