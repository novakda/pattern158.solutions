## v1.5 Requirements

Deferred to future milestone. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Content Strategy

- **CONT-01**: Low-barrier posting approach defined (1-2x/month)
- **CONT-02**: Exhibit sharing cadence established (14 exhibits = 14 weeks of content)
- **CONT-03**: Engagement strategy documented (comment on relevant posts in target industry)
- **CONT-04**: Creator mode evaluation (assess ROI for senior engineer profile)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| LinkedIn Premium subscription | Profile optimization doesn't require paid features |
| LinkedIn Recruiter tool features | Employer-side tool, not relevant to profile optimization |
| Automated posting tools | Manual posting sufficient at 1-2x/month cadence |
| Third-party LinkedIn optimization services | Deliverables are copy-paste-ready content, no external tools needed |
| Resume rewrite | Resumes are tailored per application, managed separately |
| Cover letter templates | Separate deliverable, out of scope for profile alignment |
