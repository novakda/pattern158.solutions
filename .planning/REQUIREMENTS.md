## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestone. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Profile Polish

- **POLISH-01**: Live deployment links added to pinned repos
- **POLISH-02**: Selective shields.io badges on repo READMEs (build status, coverage)
- **POLISH-03**: Polished READMEs with setup/features/examples on all pinned repos
- **POLISH-04**: Professional profile photo aligned with NTSB aesthetic

### Advanced

- **ADV-01**: Contribute to domain-relevant open-source projects (eLearning, accessibility)
- **ADV-02**: GitHub Actions dynamic README updates (if warranted)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Dynamic stats widgets (github-readme-stats, streak counters) | Unreliable on public instances, break frequently, conflict with static-first philosophy |
| Animated GIFs/banners in profile README | Conflicts with NTSB investigation aesthetic |
| Contribution graph optimization | Behavioral over time, not a one-time update |
| GitHub Sponsors profile | Requires monetization strategy outside current scope |
| Deleting forks (vs archiving) | Archiving is reversible and preserves history |
| GitHub Pages for pattern158.solutions | Site hosted elsewhere; GitHub Pages not needed |
| Polishing individual repo READMEs beyond descriptions | Deferred to future; descriptions provide immediate value |
