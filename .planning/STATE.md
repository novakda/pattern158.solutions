# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Accurately and compellingly present Dan's professional identity and body of work to hiring managers, engineers, and potential clients
**Current focus:** v1.2 — Rustici-Targeted Content + Exhibit/Nav/QA

## Current Milestone: v1.2 Rustici-Targeted Content + Quality

**Goal:** Add Rustici-relevant exhibits and positioning, then complete deferred quality audit phases.

**Target features:**
- Rustici-targeted exhibits (SCORM Debugger, CSBB Dispatch, BP Learning Platform)
- Three positioning narratives (Enterprise Integration, AI-Driven Modernization, Learning Systems)
- GM exhibit strengthening, homepage influences
- Exhibit content optimization (deferred from v1.1)
- Navigation/footer consistency (deferred from v1.1)
- Comprehensive accessibility QA (deferred from v1.1)

## Current Position

Phase: 12 complete — Rustici-targeted content implemented
Plan: N/A (Phase 12 executed directly)
Status: Phase 12 complete, awaiting roadmap for phases 13-15
Last activity: 2026-02-21 — Phase 12 content implementation

Progress: [■■■■■■■■■■■■□□□] 12/15 phases complete (80%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (15 entries).
All v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (10 entries added).

Full v1.1 decision log archived in `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`.

### v1.2 Phase 12 Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| CSBB framing: "Built 2011, 5 years before Rustici Content Controller" | Factual timeline correction — CSBB predated the commercial product |
| BP exhibit: Dan worked ON it, didn't build it | Accurate framing — Leo Learning built the platform, Dan did rebranding/troubleshooting |
| Exhibit naming: e (gap fill), m, n | Used available letter gap first, then sequential |
| Three Lenses on portfolio.html | Lightweight positioning without JS filtering |
| Influences on homepage as dl list | Compact format, links to philosophy.html for depth |
| TECH-04 (analytics) deferred past v1.2 | Not needed for immediate Rustici opportunity |
| Phase 13 P02 | 280 | 2 tasks | 7 files |

### Quick Tasks Completed (v1.0)

| # | Task | Date | Commit |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Anonymize site content — remove individual names, phone numbers, internal product names, sensitive details | 2026-02-13 | cd9f10e |
| 2 | Full content audit — verified internal links, anchors, images, sitemap; fixed FAQ link text | 2026-02-18 | 28aad09 |
| 3 | Remove manual QA and accessibility testing messaging — reframed forward-facing pages to emphasize engineering/methodology | 2026-02-20 | 45af5a3, 9f6857c |
| 4 | Mobile table rendering with PowerApps-style card transformation — 22 tables across 13 HTML files | 2026-02-20 | 10b37f0, 5ee4c46 |
