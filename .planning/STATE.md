## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Factor website out of vault GSD project (separate development lifecycle)
- This repo is source of truth (HTML is canonical form)
- Static HTML, no framework (simplicity, zero dependencies)
- NTSB investigation aesthetic (unique brand differentiator)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

**Research Notes:**
- Research identified CSS duplication as critical blocker requiring Phase 1 completion before other work
- Dark mode must use brand-aligned palette (navy/teal/cream) not generic black to preserve NTSB aesthetic
- Navigation requires absolute-from-root paths (/page.html) to avoid relative path fragility in exhibits/ subdirectory
