- [v1.3]: Starting phase numbering at 19 (continuation from v1.2's phase 18)
- [v1.3]: GitHub CLI and manual web UI for all operations (no build tools)
- [v1.3]: Brand voice consistency is critical success criterion across all phases

- [Phase 19-01]: Bio character allocation: 124/160 chars used, prioritized domain expertise + tech stack + availability + tagline
- [Phase 19-01]: Featured exhibits: Selected 4 strongest for developer audience (M, E, J, N) with developer-angle descriptions
- [Phase 19-01]: Brand intensity: 60% NTSB aesthetic, 40% GitHub native (Title Case headers, narrative skills section, footer AI acknowledgment)
- [Phase 19-02]: Quote correction applied before publication: Bio and README updated to "If you want to cheat, cheat fair." with proper Moe Howard attribution

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 19 status:**
- ✅ GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- ✅ Profile README created and published (public)
- ✅ All profile fields complete (bio, website, pronouns, LinkedIn)
- ✅ Phase 19 complete

**Phase 21 readiness:**
- Fork curation requires manual review of ~25 repositories
- Decision criteria needed for keep vs. archive judgment calls

**Phase 22 readiness:**
- Repository pinning is manual web UI only (no API/CLI support)
- Need to identify 3-6 repos that meet pinning quality bar
