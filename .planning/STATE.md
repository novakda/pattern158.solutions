## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (33 entries across v1.0-v1.2).

Recent decisions affecting v1.3:
- [v1.3]: Four phases derived from requirement categories (PROF, README, META, FORK, PIN)
- [v1.3]: Starting phase numbering at 19 (continuation from v1.2's phase 18)
- [v1.3]: GitHub CLI and manual web UI for all operations (no build tools)
- [v1.3]: Brand voice consistency is critical success criterion across all phases

Full decision logs archived in:
- `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`
- [Phase 19-01]: Bio character allocation: 124/160 chars used, prioritized domain expertise + tech stack + availability + tagline
- [Phase 19-01]: Featured exhibits: Selected 4 strongest for developer audience (M, E, J, N) with developer-angle descriptions
- [Phase 19-01]: Brand intensity: 60% NTSB aesthetic, 40% GitHub native (Title Case headers, narrative skills section, footer AI acknowledgment)
- [Phase 19-02]: Quote correction applied before publication: Bio and README updated to "If you want to cheat, cheat fair." with proper Moe Howard attribution
- [Phase 19-02]: Repository visibility flipped to public after human approval, enabling profile README display
- [Phase 20-01]: Minimal description philosophy: Let homepage URL speak for itself, include Pattern 158 brand name
- [Phase 20-01]: Domain topics only (portfolio, accessibility, wcag, static-site) targeting hiring managers and eLearning professionals
- [Phase 20-02]: Separate WCAG and SCORM topic vocabularies: aria-practices/wai-tutorials get accessibility topics only (not elearning), SCORM repos get scorm/elearning/lms topics
- [Phase 20-02]: Curate SCOBot topics from 20 to 5: Focus on scorm, elearning, javascript, scorm-api, lms for better discoverability signal
- [Phase 21]: Archive 5 eLearning forks to signal 'evaluated and preserved' rather than 'actively maintained'
- [Phase 21]: Keep get-shit-done fork active as it's a dev tool currently in use
- [Phase 21]: 4-dimension verification ensures all repo metadata (count, archive status, descriptions, topics) remain intact
