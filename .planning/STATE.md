## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (33 entries across v1.0-v1.2).

Recent decisions affecting v1.3:
- [v1.3]: Four phases derived from requirement categories (PROF, README, META, FORK, PIN)
- [v1.3]: Starting phase numbering at 19 (continuation from v1.2's phase 18)
- [v1.3]: GitHub CLI and manual web UI for all operations (no build tools)
- [v1.3]: Brand voice consistency is critical success criterion across all phases

Full decision logs archived in:
- `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 19 readiness:**
- Need GitHub CLI installed (`gh`) for repository operations
- Need GitHub authentication configured for CLI
- Profile README content requires brand voice review before publishing

**Phase 21 readiness:**
- Fork curation requires manual review of ~25 repositories
- Decision criteria needed for keep vs. archive judgment calls

**Phase 22 readiness:**
- Repository pinning is manual web UI only (no API/CLI support)
- Need to identify 3-6 repos that meet pinning quality bar
