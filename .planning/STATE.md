## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (15 entries).

**v1.1 Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Foundation-first phase ordering (CSS → Content → Layout → Typography → Color → Exhibits → Nav → QA) | Dependencies drive order: content depends on clean CSS, layout depends on final content, typography depends on layout rhythm, color depends on typography (contrast), exhibits use established system, nav after content stable, QA last for comprehensive verification | — Planned |
| UX over brand when conflicting | Best practices should win over aesthetic when they improve usability | — Pending |
| Standard depth (8 phases) for 30 requirements | Balanced grouping: foundation (2), visual polish (3), content polish (1), global consistency (1), verification (1) | ✓ Good |
