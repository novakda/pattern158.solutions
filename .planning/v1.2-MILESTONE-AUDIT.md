# Milestone v1.2 Audit: Rustici-Targeted Content + Quality

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** complete
**Milestone Goal:** Add Rustici-relevant exhibits and positioning narratives, then complete deferred quality audit phases from v1.1.

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.2 fully achieved its definition of done. **All 20 requirements are satisfied** with comprehensive verification evidence. All 6 E2E user flows are complete. Cross-phase integration is verified at 100% — no orphaned exports, no broken links, no missing connections.

**All requirements complete:** Full WCAG AA compliance achieved across all 21 pages in both light and dark modes (270/270 tests pass). Documentation conflicts resolved. ROADMAP tracking corrected.

**No blockers exist.** All tech debt items resolved.

## Requirement A11Y-02 Resolution

**Requirement:** Full WCAG AA re-verification passes after all v1.2 changes

**Final Status:** SATISFIED (completed across Phases 15, 17, 18)

**What was delivered:**
- Light mode: 21/21 pages pass WCAG AA (100%) — completed Phase 15-02
- Dark mode: 21/21 pages pass WCAG AA (100%) — completed Phase 17
- Semantic HTML: all pages restructured with proper landmarks and heading hierarchy
- ARIA attributes correct and complete
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- Automated test suite permanent and re-runnable
- 270/270 total tests passing (135 per browser: Chromium + Firefox)

**Resolution timeline:**
- Phase 15-02: Fixed light mode badge contrast, brought dark mode from 0% to 98%
- Phase 17: Fixed remaining dark mode badge contrast (Exhibit L severity-critical badges)
- Phase 18: Resolved conflicting documentation between 15-02-SUMMARY and 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT

**Documentation reconciliation:**
- 15-02-SUMMARY.md was correct: light 100%, dark partial (98% after Phase 15-02)
- 15-ACCESSIBILITY-REPORT.md had inverted light/dark data — corrected in Phase 18
- Phase 17 brought dark mode to 100%, closing the A11Y-02 gap completely
