# Milestone v1.2 Audit: Rustici-Targeted Content + Quality

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** passed
**Milestone Goal:** Add Rustici-relevant exhibits and positioning narratives, then complete deferred quality audit phases from v1.1.
**Re-audit:** Yes — supersedes previous audit (2026-02-21) which preceded Phases 17-18 completion

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.2 fully achieved its definition of done. **All 20 requirements are satisfied** with comprehensive verification evidence across 3 independent sources. All 5 E2E user flows are complete. Cross-phase integration is verified at 100% across all 7 phases — no orphaned exports, no broken links, no missing connections.

**All requirements complete.** Full WCAG AA compliance achieved across all 21 pages in both light and dark modes (270/270 tests pass). Documentation conflicts resolved. ROADMAP tracking corrected. All tech debt items resolved except 1 accepted limitation (WebKit testing disabled).

**No blockers exist.** Milestone is ready for closure.

### Final Status Determination

| A11Y-05 | Light/dark mode verification | SATISFIED | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |
| A11Y-06 | Semantic HTML verified | SATISFIED | missing | [x] | **satisfied** |

**Note on A11Y requirements SUMMARY gap:** A11Y-02 through A11Y-06 are absent from SUMMARY frontmatter (Phase 15 SUMMARYs lack `requirements-completed` field). Per status matrix this triggers "verify manually." Manual verification confirms all 5 are satisfied: 270/270 tests pass, 20/20 must-haves in 15-VERIFICATION.md, 4/4 must-haves in 17-VERIFICATION.md. This is a documentation format gap, not a verification gap.

**Satisfied:** 20/20
**Partial:** 0/20
**Unsatisfied:** 0/20
**Orphaned:** 0/20

**FAIL gate check:** No unsatisfied requirements. PASS.
**Orphan detection:** No requirements in traceability table absent from all VERIFICATIONs. PASS.
