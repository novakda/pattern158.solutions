# Milestone v1.2 Audit Report: Rustici-Targeted Content + Quality

**Audited:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** gaps_found
**Milestone Goal:** Add Rustici-relevant exhibits and positioning narratives, then complete deferred quality audit phases from v1.1.

## Scores

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 12/20 | 4 satisfied (EXHIBIT), 8 orphaned (CONTENT — delivered but no VERIFICATION), 8 unsatisfied (NAV + A11Y phases not started) |
| Phases | 2/4 | Phase 12 complete (no GSD artifacts), Phase 13 complete (verified), Phases 14-15 not started |
| Integration | 7/8 | 1 critical gap: testimonials.html missing exhibits E, M, N |
| E2E Flows | 1/2 | Homepage → Portfolio → Exhibit ✓, Homepage → Field Reports → Exhibit ✗ (missing 3 exhibits) |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 12: Rustici-Targeted Content

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| CONTENT-05 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-06 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-07 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-08 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-09 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-10 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-11 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |
| CONTENT-12 | missing | missing | [x] | **orphaned** |

**Note:** All 8 CONTENT requirements have codebase evidence of delivery (commit c3a215c, integration checker confirmed). The gap is documentation — Phase 12 was executed as a quick task without GSD plan/summary/verification artifacts.

### Phase 13: Exhibit Content Optimization

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| EXHIBIT-01 | passed | listed (13-01) | [x] | **satisfied** |
| EXHIBIT-02 | passed | listed (13-01) | [x] | **satisfied** |
| EXHIBIT-03 | passed | listed (13-03) | [x] | **satisfied** |
| EXHIBIT-04 | passed | listed (13-03) | [x] | **satisfied** |

### Phase 14: Navigation & Footer Consistency (NOT STARTED)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| NAV-05 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| NAV-06 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| NAV-07 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |

### Phase 15: Comprehensive Accessibility QA (NOT STARTED)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| A11Y-02 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| A11Y-03 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| A11Y-04 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| A11Y-05 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| A11Y-06 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |

## Integration Check Results

### Critical Issues

**1. Testimonials Page Missing Phase 12 Exhibits (E, M, N)**

- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Affects:** CONTENT-05, CONTENT-06, CONTENT-07, EXHIBIT-04
- **Location:** testimonials.html (ends at Exhibit L, line 507)
- **Issue:** Phase 12 created 3 new exhibits integrated into portfolio.html and navigation, but NOT into testimonials.html ("Field Reports"). Hiring managers using the Field Reports entry point see 11/14 exhibits, missing all Rustici-targeted content.
- **Fix:** Add exhibit cards for E, M, N to testimonials.html

### Warnings

**2. Footer Inconsistency Across Pages**
- **Affects:** NAV-06
- **Issue:** index.html and testimonials.html use `<footer id="contact">` with attribution class; other pages use standard footer without id.

**3. E2E Flow Broken via Testimonials Route**
- **Affects:** User experience, content discovery
- **Issue:** Homepage "View All Field Reports" button → testimonials.html shows incomplete exhibit list (11/14).

### Verified (No Issues)

- CSS pattern support: section-heading, key-fact, report-section patterns all in main.css
- Navigation structure: 100% identical across all 21 production pages (7 nav items)
- Sitemap coverage: 21/21 URLs present including exhibits E, M, N
- Cross-reference integrity: 0 broken links across all pages
- Phase 12 → Phase 13 wiring: Exhibits created in Phase 12 properly processed in Phase 13
- Homepage and philosophy cross-references to new exhibits work correctly

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | VERIFICATION.md | Plans/Summaries | Requirements |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 12. Rustici-Targeted Content | ✅ Complete (quick execution) | missing | 0/0 (no directory) | 8/8 orphaned |
| 13. Exhibit Content Optimization | ✅ Complete (verified) | passed | 3/3 | 4/4 satisfied |
| 14. Navigation & Footer Consistency | ❌ Not started | missing | 0/0 (no directory) | 0/3 unsatisfied |
| 15. Comprehensive Accessibility QA | ❌ Not started | missing | 0/0 (no directory) | 0/5 unsatisfied |

## Tech Debt

**Phase 12:**
- No GSD artifacts (PLAN, SUMMARY, VERIFICATION) — executed as quick task with single commit
- testimonials.html not updated with new exhibits

**Phase 13:**
- visual-audit.mjs and debug scripts left in project root (cleanup needed)

## Summary

**4/20 requirements formally satisfied** (EXHIBIT-01 through EXHIBIT-04 via Phase 13 verification).

**8/20 requirements orphaned** (CONTENT-05 through CONTENT-12 — delivered in codebase per integration check and git commit c3a215c, but no GSD VERIFICATION.md exists for Phase 12).

**8/20 requirements unsatisfied** (NAV-05 through NAV-07, A11Y-02 through A11Y-06 — Phases 14 and 15 not started).

**1 critical integration gap:** testimonials.html missing 3 Phase 12 exhibits.
